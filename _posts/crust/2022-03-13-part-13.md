A brief wrap up, a few thoughts and where to next.

## Journey's end

Well here we are at the end of the `crust` series. I have thoroughly enjoyed researching the Rust language and putting it into practice over the last year or so. Being able to articulate how to use it for a basic 3D engine has been a cool outcome and a fun use case to study with.

I hope that if you have an interest in the Rust language this might offer a bit of insight into it. Even if you don't care about 3D graphics we also wrote a fully functional command line application, which is probably more like the typical use case for Rust.

It is hard to tell where Rust might find a stronghold amongst other languages available today - it doesn't really seem to be a good fit for general purpose business logic applications due to the rigidity and learning curve of the borrower and ownership models.

It does seem to perform quite well as a systems level language though and some of its main selling points are around performance and writing safer memory management code. Perhaps if performance was one of the key requirements Rust might be a good option.

At this point I'll wrap up my Rust research as it's been consuming a lot of my spare time over the last year, but if (when?) I get motivated again I might write a follow up series about implementing the Vulkan graphics API into `crust` ... stay tuned!
