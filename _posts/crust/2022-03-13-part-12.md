In this article we will create a new Xcode project and implement the `crust-build` pipeline for building the iOS target platform. This will let us run `crust` on an iPhone - such that it could also be published to the Apple App Store - though you would need an active Apple Developer subscription to do that. We will:

- Create a new Xcode iOS project which invokes `crust-build` as part of its build pipeline
- Fill in the implementation of the iOS build target in our `crust-build` project

<!-- excerpt -->

<hr />

## Xcode project

In the previous article we implemented the MacOS Desktop target - for iOS we will take a very similar approach in that the Xcode project will invoke `crust-build` through a shell script build step to compile and prepare the Rust dependencies.

To start off, create a new `ios` directory in your workspace:

```
+ root
    + android
    + crust-build
    + crust-main
    + ios
    + macos-desktop
```

Then open Xcode and create a new iOS app project:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-01.png"/>

Fill in the details as below - again noting that we don't need Swift support as we will write barely any Apple code:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-02.png"/>

Select your `ios` directory to save the project into. After completion it should look like this:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-03.png"/>

In the `Deployment Info` section, change the following settings:

- Uncheck `Portrait` in `Device Orientation`
- Check `Hide status bar` in `Status bar style`
- Check `Requires full screen` in `Status bar style`
- Delete `main` from the `Main Interface` field

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-04.png"/>

Next we will delete redundant source files that our app won't need. Delete the following files (choose `Move to Trash`):

- `AppDelegate.h`
- `AppDelegate.m`
- `SceneDelegate.h`
- `SceneDelegate.m`
- `ViewController.h`
- `ViewController.m`
- `Main.storyboard`

Your project should now look like this:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-05.png"/>

The directory structure should be like:

```
+ root
    ...
    + ios
        + crust
            + crust
            + crust.xcodeproj
```

## Default PLIST

We need to tidy a few things in the `Info.plist` file as well, open it and delete the `Scene configuration` node as it contains references to some of the source files we just removed.

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-clean-plist.png"/>

Also delete the two *portrait* related properties for iPad support - we only want `crust` to run in landscape regardless of phone or tablet:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-remove-ipad-orientations.png"/>

## Invoke shell script

Next we will add the shell script build step which will invoke `crust-build` for the iOS target. Navigate to the `Build Phases` section and add a new script step:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-06.png"/>

Move the script step as far up the list as possible - just under the `Dependencies` step, disable the `Based on dependency analysis` checkbox and enter the following script:

```sh
set -e
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin"
cd "$SRCROOT/../../crust-build"
cargo run -- --target ios --variant $CONFIGURATION
```

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-07.png"/>

This is exactly the same as what we did for the MacOS Desktop article, except we are specifying `ios` for `crust-build` instead of `macos-desktop`.

You can run the Xcode project now and observe in the *Report navigator* that our `crust-build` application ran. You will have build errors but we'll fix that soon enough.

## Rust build implementation

The Rust code to build iOS is a bit more complicated than for the MacOS targets because we can't use SDL as frameworks - rather we need them to be *static libraries*.

We also have an additional complication that with the introduction of Apple Silicon Mac computers, we have to differentiate between `arm64` *simulators* versus `arm64` *devices* - historically there was an assumption that building for `arm64` means a phsyical phone which is no longer the case. We will need to build our Rust code for 3 targets:

- iOS Simulator (x86_64)
- iOS Simulator (arm64)
- iOS Devices (arm64)

We also need to combine the two simulator architectures together as they are not regarded as discrete platforms in the Xcode tooling.

The build flow for iOS is:

- Install Rust toolchain dependencies for `aarch64-apple-ios`, `aarch64-apple-ios-sim` and `x86_64-apple-ios`
- Setup a `Frameworks` directory and symlink it into the Xcode project structure
- Build the SDL2 source code and produce a custom `xcframework` containing its build outputs
- Build the SDL2 Image source code and produce a custom `xcframework` containing its build outputs
- Create a custom `Cargo.toml` manifest to specify a `crate-type` of `staticlib` - we did something similar in the Android target to change the Cargo crate type
- Build our Rust source code for each of the three architectures
- Join the resulting outputs into an `xcframework` containing our compiled code as a static library

I'll step through this flow a bit more methodically than we did for MacOS Desktop as some of the code needs a bit of explaining as we go.

## Rust toolchains

Edit `crust-build/src/ios.rs` and add the following constants:

```rust
const ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_IPHONE: &str = "aarch64-apple-ios";
const ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_SIMULATOR: &str = "aarch64-apple-ios-sim";
const ARCHITECTURE_X86_64_SIMULATOR: &str = "x86_64-apple-ios";
```

Then add a new method to install the required Rust toolchains - there isn't anything here you haven't seen before:

```rust
fn install_rust_dependencies() -> FailableUnit {
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!(
        "rustup target add {} {} {}",
        ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_IPHONE, ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_SIMULATOR, ARCHITECTURE_X86_64_SIMULATOR
    )))
}
```

Update the `build` method:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Setup frameworks directory

Add the following method to create a new `Frameworks` working directory where our custom `xcframeworks` will be published to, along with a symlink inside the Xcode project directory structure:

```rust
fn setup_frameworks_dir(context: &Context) -> Failable<PathBuf> {
    let frameworks_dir = context.working_dir.join("Frameworks");
    io::create_dir(&frameworks_dir)?;
    io::create_symlink(&frameworks_dir, &context.target_home_dir.join("crust").join("Frameworks"), &context.working_dir)?;

    Ok(frameworks_dir)
}
```

Update `build` to call this method and hold onto the resulting directory path:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = setup_frameworks_dir(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Setup SDL2

Ok this is where things start to get a bit more involved. We will need to download the SDL2 source code then build the static library Xcode project within it for all three of our target architectures. The SDL2 source code doesn't currently (at the time of writing this) have an `xcframework` output target of its own, so we need to manufacture our own `xcframework` once all the architectures are built.

Add the following constants:

```rust
const SDL2_URL: &str = "https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.14.zip";
const SDL2_DIR: &str = "SDL";
const SDL2_FRAMEWORK_NAME: &str = "SDL2.xcframework";
```

The `SDL2_FRAMEWORK_NAME` constant is the name of the `xcframework` we will manufacture with the outputs of the compiled source code.

> Note: The directory where for SDL2 source code must be `SDL` so libraries such as `SDL2_image` can automatically locate it.

Add the following method:

```rust
fn setup_sdl2(context: &Context, frameworks_dir: &PathBuf) -> FailableUnit {
    let xcframework_path = frameworks_dir.join(SDL2_FRAMEWORK_NAME);

    if xcframework_path.exists() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    // The source code for SDL2 needs to be available for us to build the framework.
    remote_zips::fetch(SDL2_URL, SDL2_DIR, &context.working_dir)?;

    // This is the directory where the SDL2 Xcode project can be found which when compiled produces the static libraries we need.
    let xcode_project_dir = context.working_dir.join(SDL2_DIR).join("Xcode").join("SDL");

    // We need to build the static library for both simulators (ARM64 + x86_64). Note also that we are deliberately building the Release variant only.
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Compiling SDL2 simulator release static library ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(
        r#"xcodebuild -project "SDL.xcodeproj" -scheme "Static Library-iOS" -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath "build_iphonesimulator" -arch arm64 -arch x86_64 only_active_arch=no"#
    ).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    // We now need to build the static library for the phone target (ARM64).
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Compiling SDL2 phone release static library ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(
        r#"xcodebuild -project "SDL.xcodeproj" -scheme "Static Library-iOS" -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos -derivedDataPath "build_iphoneos" -arch arm64 only_active_arch=no"#
    ).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    // Once both the simulators + phone static libraries have been built, we need to merge them together into an XCFramework which will be embedded in the iOS project.
    let headers_path = context.working_dir.join(SDL2_DIR).join("include");
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Creating SDL2 XCFramework ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!(
        r#"xcodebuild -create-xcframework -library build_iphonesimulator/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/libSDL2.a -headers {:?} -library build_iphoneos/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/libSDL2.a -headers {:?} -output {:?}"#,
        &headers_path,
        &headers_path,
        &xcframework_path
    )).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

I have added code comments to describe what each part of the method does, but in essence we are compiling the SDL2 source code for both the `iphonesimulator` and `iphoneos` platforms, specifying explicitly the `-derivedDataPath` so we know where the build outputs land.

Then we use the Xcode `-create-xcframework` command line tool to generate our custom `SDL2.xcframework`, pulling into it the `libSDL2.a` outputs from the `build_iphonesimulator` and `build_iphoneos` derived data paths.

The result is an SDL2 `xcframework` that contains the compiled static library artifacts to support iOS simulators and phones. We want to use the `xcframework` approach to let Xcode build against the appropriate platform architecture automatically.

Update the `build` method to run this:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = setup_frameworks_dir(context)?;
    
    setup_sdl2(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
 
    Ok(())
}
```

## Setup SDL2 Image

The setup for SDL2 Image is very similar to SDL2. First add some constants:

```rust
const SDL2_IMAGE_URL: &str = "https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-2.0.5.zip";
const SDL2_IMAGE_DIR: &str = "SDL2_image";
const SDL2_IMAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME: &str = "SDL2_image.xcframework";
```

Then add a new method to prepare the SDL2 Image libraries:

```rust
fn setup_sdl2_image(context: &Context, frameworks_dir: &PathBuf) -> FailableUnit {
    let xcframework_path = frameworks_dir.join(SDL2_IMAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME);

    // No need to build if its output already exist.
    if xcframework_path.exists() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    // The source code for SDL2 image needs to be available for us to build the framework.
    remote_zips::fetch(SDL2_IMAGE_URL, SDL2_IMAGE_DIR, &context.working_dir)?;

    // // This is the directory where the SDL2 Image Xcode project can be found which when compiled produces the static libraries we need.
    let xcode_project_dir = context.working_dir.join(SDL2_IMAGE_DIR).join("Xcode-iOS");

    // We need to build the static library for both simulators (ARM64 + x86_64). Note also that we are deliberately building the Release variant only.
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Compiling SDL2 Image simulator release static library ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(
        r#"xcodebuild -project "SDL_image.xcodeproj" -scheme "libSDL_image-iOS" -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath "build_iphonesimulator" -arch arm64 -arch x86_64 only_active_arch=no"#
    ).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    // We now need to build the static library for the phone target (ARM64).
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Compiling SDL2 Image phone release static library ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(
        r#"xcodebuild -project "SDL_image.xcodeproj" -scheme "libSDL_image-iOS" -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos -derivedDataPath "build_iphoneos" -arch arm64 only_active_arch=no"#
    ).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    // Once both the simulators + phone static libraries have been built, we need to merge them together into an XCFramework which will be embedded in the iOS project.
    // Note: We do not need to include the headers in the framework as we won't be accessing them in our iOS project directly.
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Creating SDL2 Image XCFramework ...");
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!(
        r#"xcodebuild -create-xcframework -library build_iphonesimulator/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/libSDL2_image.a -library build_iphoneos/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/libSDL2_image.a -output {:?}"#,
    &xcframework_path)).working_dir(&xcode_project_dir))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Although the code is very similar to the SDL2 library, I haven't tried to be too clever and extract out the common parts, preferring a bit of duplication to keep the code easier to read - fundamentally though we are doing the same thing.

Update the `build` method to run this:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = setup_frameworks_dir(context)?;
    
    setup_sdl2(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    setup_sdl2_image(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
 
    Ok(())
}
```

## Update crate type for build

Next up we need to use our `manifests` service that we wrote in the Android article to create a copy of the main `Cargo.toml` but replace the `crate-type` property to `staticlib`. If we don't do this, our own Rust code will not be compiled in a way that we can link as a static library in Xcode.

Update the `build` method to create a manifest with `staticlib` as the `crate-type` via the `manifests::create` invocation:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = setup_frameworks_dir(context)?;
    
    setup_sdl2(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    setup_sdl2_image(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    
    manifests::create(context, "staticlib")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Compile Rust code

We can now compile our Rust code, keeping in mind that we need to build the *library* Rust target rather than the *binary* target. We will loop through each of the three architectures and perform the appropriate Rust compilation command:

> Note: debug builds will produce WAY bigger output files compared to release builds which are much more compact.

```rust
fn compile(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    for architecture in &vec![
        ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_IPHONE,
        ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_SIMULATOR,
        ARCHITECTURE_X86_64_SIMULATOR,
    ] {
        logs::out(log_tag!(), &format!("Compiling crust for architecture: {}", &architecture));
        scripts::run(
            &Script::new(&format!(
                "cargo rustc {} --target-dir {:?} --lib --target {}",
                context.variant.rust_compiler_flag(),
                context.rust_build_dir,
                architecture,
            ))
            .working_dir(&context.working_dir),
        )?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

The Rust compilation command is fairly straight forward - we just tell it to target each of our iOS architectures one at a time. Update `build` to run the compilation:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = setup_frameworks_dir(context)?;
    setup_sdl2(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    setup_sdl2_image(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    manifests::create(context, "staticlib")?;
    compile(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Create output

The final part of the Rust implementation is to collect the compiled Rust code artifacts and merge them into a single static library `xcframework` that our Xcode project can consume. I have added comments in the code to describe what we are doing:

```rust
fn create_output(context: &Context, frameworks_dir: &PathBuf) -> FailableUnit {
    let variant_dir = context.variant.id();

    // Now that each of the architectures has been compiled, we need to generate an XCFramework which merges them all together for the iOS project.
    // When generating an XCFramework we must actually join any compiled architectures that belong to the same family together first - in our case
    // we have compiled 2 iOS simulator architectures (ARM64 + x86_64). If we were to try and make an XCFramework where each of the simulator
    // architectures were bundled separately, the XCFramework command would fail so we must first join them into 1 static library. To join compiled
    // architectures together we use the 'lipo' tool.
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Joining iOS simulator architectures together ...");
    let simulator_static_library_dir = context
        .rust_build_dir
        .join(&format!("{}-{}", ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_SIMULATOR, ARCHITECTURE_X86_64_SIMULATOR))
        .join(variant_dir);

    // Make sure the path to our merged static library exists.
    io::create_dir(&simulator_static_library_dir)?;

    let simulator_static_library_path = simulator_static_library_dir.join("libcrustlib.a");

    scripts::run(
        &Script::new(&format!(
            "lipo -create -output {:?} {:?} {:?}",
            &simulator_static_library_path,
            &context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_SIMULATOR).join(variant_dir).join("libcrustlib.a"),
            &context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_X86_64_SIMULATOR).join(variant_dir).join("libcrustlib.a"),
        ))
        .working_dir(&context.working_dir),
    )?;

    // Now that we have a static library for the iPhone architecture and a static library representing both iOS simulator architectures (via the lipo tool),
    // we can build the XCFramework which wraps it all up and can then be used as a framework dependency in the iOS project.
    let xcframework_path = frameworks_dir.join("crust.xcframework");
    let iphone_static_library_path =
        context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_ARM64_IPHONE).join(variant_dir).join("libcrustlib.a");

    // Start off by deleting the existing framework if it exists - we should do this so building a debug/release variant always produces the appropriate XCFramework.
    io::delete(&xcframework_path)?;

    // Now run the appropriate Xcode command to create the framework.
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Creating XCFramework for 'crust' ...");
    scripts::run(
        &Script::new(&format!(
            "xcodebuild -create-xcframework -library {:?} -library {:?} -output {:?}",
            &iphone_static_library_path, &simulator_static_library_path, &xcframework_path,
        ))
        .working_dir(&context.working_dir),
    )?;

    // The Frameworks directory now contains 'crust.xcframework' ready to be used in the iOS Xcode project.
    Ok(())
}
```

Update the `build` method to call this too - the full source code for `ios.rs` will end up like this:

```rust

Save `ios.rs`, go back to Xcode and run the app again, triggering our new Rust build code. You should see a whole heap of `crust-build` activity when the shell script step is run and it may take some time to finish while it is downloading and compiling the SDL2 libraries and our Rust code:

```

When the build is complete (you will still get a build error which we'll fix soon), you can observe the following new files and directories:

```
+ root
    + ios
        + .rust-build
        + crust
            + Frameworks (symlink)
                + crust.xcframework
                + SDL2.xcframework
                + SDL2_image.xcframework                
```

If you were to look inside one of the frameworks you will see that is a static library for two platforms:

- `ios-arm64`: Physical iPhone devices
- `ios-arm64_x86_64_simulator`: The combined architectures for iOS simulators, which we had merged together via the `lipo` tool

## Assets

We can now focus on the Xcode project again, first by adding our 3D models, textures and shader files. Right click on the `crust` folder in Xcode and add files to the project:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-08.png" />

Select `crust-main/assets` and leave the options as shown below:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-09.png" />

Your project should then look like this:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-10.png" />

Similar to the MacOS Desktop project, these assets will be bundled into our resulting iOS app during the build.

## Frameworks

Next up we will add all the required frameworks - there are actually quite a few to add but most of them are Apple ones.

Navigate to the `Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content` section in the `Build` tab of the `crust` target:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-11.png" />

One by one, add the following frameworks, leaving them as `Do Not Embed`:

- `AudioToolbox.framework`
- `AVFoundation.framework`
- `CoreAudio.framework`
- `CoreGraphics.framework`
- `CoreHaptics.framework`
- `CoreMotion.framework`
- `CoreServices.framework`
- `Foundation.framework`
- `GameController.framework`
- `ImageIO.framework`
- `Metal.framework`
- `OpenGLES.framework`
- `QuartzCore.framework`
- `Security.framework`
- `UIKit.framework`

Next we will add our SDL and Rust frameworks that we compiled ourselves. Add a new framework and select the `Add Other` -> `Add Files` option. Select the three `xcframework` directories in our `Frameworks` symlink location - leave them as `Embed & Sign`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-12.png" />

The frameworks section should look like this when you are done:

<img src="/images/crust/part-12/xcode-step-13.png" />

Now go to the `Build Settings` tab and add an entry to the `Framework Search Paths` field of `$(SRCROOT)/Frameworks` - this is very similar to what we did in the MacOS Desktop target and allows our custom frameworks to be found at build time.

## Bootstrap

One of the main differences between the iOS and MacOS targets is that on iOS we don't actually compile a *binary* version of `crust` - instead we made the `crust.xcframework` which is really more of a library. In order to launch our `crust` application we actually need for this method to be run which we introduced during the Android article:

```rust
#[cfg(any(target_os = "android", target_os = "ios"))]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn SDL_main(_argc: libc::c_int, _argv: *const *const libc::c_char) -> libc::c_int {
    main();
    return 0;
}
```

The `SDL_main` method is a bit magical - the SDL framework itself will automatically run this method instead of a `main` method, so long as include the file `SDL.h` in our code. Edit `main.m` and replace it with:

```objectivec
// Including the SDL header will cause the default main function
// to be redirected to the SDL main method instead. This means
// we don't even have to bootstrap our application - it will
// happen automatically.
#include "SDL.h"
```

It seems a bit crazy but that is literally all we need to do for our `crust` code to be invoked via the `SDL_main` we included.

Now run the app again and bask in the brilliance of `crust` on iOS!

## Summary

Woohoo! That was the last of our target platforms integrated with `crust`!
