In this article we will implement the `crust-build` pipeline for building out the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) target platform. This gives us a web brower compatible version of `crust` - letting us run our application embedded in a web page! We will:

- Fill in the implementation of the Emscripten build target in our `crust-build` project to orchestrate the build steps to prepare and perform.
- Update the `crust-main` source code to become Emscripten aware - there are a few things we have to do differently to run our main loop and know about the display size for Emscripten.

> Note: Our `crust-build` implementation for Emscripten will be cross platform - meaning you will be able to do an Emscripten target build on either Windows *or* MacOS.

## Emscripten in Rust

Rust offers the *tier 2* `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` build toolchain for compiling Emscripten compatible code - *tier 2* means that it isn't fully verified and tested on each Rust release, meaning there can be times when a new version of Rust will cause breaking changes.

I actually encountered this twice:

- On Rust 2018 I had to deliberately use a much older version of the Emscripten SDK to retain compatibility with the Rust toolchain
- Upon upgrading to Rust 2021, my Emscripten implementation completely broke so I had to upgrade the Emscripten SDK, but on earlier versions of Rust 2021 (up to about Rust `1.53.0`) this too was broken and I had to apply some fairly hacky workarounds

On each occasion it took me many days to find a way to successfully build and run Emscripten with Rust and I almost rage quit the Emscripten target from the `crust` project because of it. Thankfully though, after updating to Rust `1.59.0`, the issues I encountered seem to have been resolved and I was able to use a fairly recent Emscripten SDK version and compile `crust` successfully without needing any hacky workarounds.

We will be compiling our own `crust` application code using the Rust Emscripten toolchain which will subsequently use the Emscripten SDK to build the final output. We will also need to make some changes to our `crust-main` code to accommodate Emscripten, as it requires some special `C` interop into the Emscripten SDK in order to bootstrap and run a main loop unlike our regular targets.

I wrote a fairly detailed article about building Emscripten with a `C++` project in [Part 6 - Setup Emscripten](/a-simple-triangle/2019/03/10/part-06/) of `A Simple Triangle`. We will be doing some of the same steps in our Rust implementation but actually it will be a fair bit easier as we won't need to wrangle *CMake* files or anything.

## Build introduction

We'll start with the `crust-build` implementation first to get the build pipeline working, then loop back and fix up some code in the `crust-main` project to make it Emscripten aware.

We also won't be adding a new debug profile into Visual Studio Code, instead we will just manually run the build from the command line - you can do this either inside a terminal within Visual Studio Code, or in a separate terminal window, so long as you are in the `crust-build` directory when you run it. The command we'll be running is:

```
cargo run -- --target emscripten --variant debug
```

or for a *release* build:

```
cargo run -- --target emscripten --variant release
```

Run the debug command now and check that you see build output like below:

```
$ cargo run -- --target emscripten --variant debug
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
     Running `target/debug/crust-build --target emscripten`
[ print_summary ] ---------------------------------------------
[ print_summary ] Assets dir:          "<snip>/crust-main/assets"

[ print_summary ] Target home dir:     "<snip>/emscripten"
[ print_summary ] Main source dir:     "<snip>/crust-main"
[ print_summary ] ---------------------------------------------
```

The process for our Emscripten build goes like this:

1. Install the `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` Rust toolchain if needed, and also install via Cargo the `https` utility which allows us to run a simple HTTP server to preview the compiled Emscripten application after a build. The HTTP server component isn't strictly needed to actually do an Emscripten build, but you can only browse the final output on a web server.
2. Download, install and activate the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) which contains the `emcc` compiler and toolchains that we need in order to build `crust` as an Emscripten application.
3. Compile our Rust code using the Rust Emscripten toolchain, letting Rust know where our Emscripten SDK is located so it can participate in the build.
4. Create the build output by copying the compiled files and generating an `index.html` web page template that loads the compiled Emscripten application.
5. Launch a basic web server within the output directory, so browsing to `http://localhost:8000` will load the `index.html` file we generated - therefore loading `crust` in the browser!

For the following steps we will be editing `emscripten.rs` in the `crust-build` project so open it now. Note also that you'll need to update the `use` section as we go if any new types are needed in the code - I won't spell out what each of them are (you should be able to figure it out) but you can always look at the final source code if you get stuck.

## Installing Rust toolchains

Add the following method:

```rust
fn install_rust_dependencies() -> FailableUnit {
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Installing Rust dependencies ...");

    scripts::run(&Script::new("rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten"))?;
    scripts::run(&Script::new("cargo install --version 1.12.0 https"))
}
```

This installs the `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` Rust toolchain and the `https` utility through Cargo. Update the `build` method to invoke this:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();
    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Downloading and configuring Emscripten SDK

The Emscripten SDK is a rather large download and it fetches additional components the first time it is used however the basic process of setting it up is straightforward. Add the following constants - near the top of the source file is fine:

```rust
const EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION: &str = "2.0.32";
const EMSCRIPTEN_URL: &str = "https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/archive/refs/tags/2.0.32.zip";
```

You can see that we are downloading the SDK from GitHub, and for this project we'll use version `2.0.32`. No doubt there will be later versions available by time you are reading this but I can't comment on how compatible they would be with the instructions I'm offering in this series.

Add the following methods to fetch and configure the SDK:

```rust
fn sdk_dir_name() -> String {
    format!("emscripten-sdk-{}", EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION)
}

fn sdk_dir(context: &Context) -> PathBuf {
    context.working_dir.join(&sdk_dir_name())
}

fn configure_emscripten_sdk(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Configuring Emscripten SDK - this may take a while ...");

    let emsdk = sdk_dir(context).join("emsdk");

    remote_zips::fetch(EMSCRIPTEN_URL, &sdk_dir_name(), &context.working_dir)?;
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!("{:?} install {}", &emsdk, EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION)))?;
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!("{:?} activate {}", &emsdk, EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION)))
}
```

 The `sdk_dir_name` and `sdk_dir` methods return the directory name and location of the downloaded SDK - we will need to know these paths in some of the other methods we'll write which is why we've extracted them like this. When the SDK has been downloaded you would have a directory structure like:

 ```
 + root
    + emscripten
        + .rust-build
            + emscripten-sdk-2.0.32
 ```

 The `configure_emscripten_sdk` method downloads the SDK if required, then invokes the `install` followed by `activate` commands, per the [setup documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#emsdk-install-targets).

 Update the `build` method to invoke this:

 ```rust
 pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();
    install_rust_dependencies()?;
    configure_emscripten_sdk(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
 ```

 Make sure you have a decent internet connection, then run a build. You should see the Emscripten SDK downloading, then *installing* and *activating*. The first time this happens it can take quite a while as it needs to fetch subsequent internal dependencies of its own, but subsequent builds will be much quicker (output below is trimmed for brevity):

```

```

## Compiling application

Sweet, now that we have installed the Emscripten SDK we can use the Rust Emscripten toolchain to compile `crust-main`. Add the following method:

```rust
fn compile_application(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Compiling application ...");

    let emscripten_flags = format!(
        r#"-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_main","_fileno"]' -O2 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' -s USE_WEBGL2=1 --preload-file {:?}@/assets"#,
        &context.assets_dir
    );

    let mut environment = HashMap::new();
    environment.insert("EMCC_CFLAGS".to_owned(), emscripten_flags);

    let script_prefix = if cfg!(target_os = "windows") {
        "emsdk_env.bat &"
    } else {
        ". ./emsdk_env.sh &&"
    };

    scripts::run(
        &Script::new(&format!(
            r#"{} cargo rustc {} --manifest-path {:?} --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten --bin crust --target-dir {:?}"#,
            &script_prefix,
            context.variant.rust_compiler_flag(),
            context.source_dir.join("Cargo.toml"),
            context.rust_build_dir,
        ))
        .working_dir(&sdk_dir(context))
        .environment(&environment),
    )
}
```

This method contains much of the magic sauce to doing an Emscripten build with Rust - in particular we need to *correctly* set the [EMCC_CFLAGS](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html?highlight=emcc_cflags) environment variable with the Emscripten specific build settings for our project. Some of these settings are very sensitive and if set incorrectly can result in a failed build or a build that fails at runtime. Read up on the Emscripten documentation to learn more about them. Of note you can see the `--preload-file` argument which will bundle up our assets into the compiled artifacts.

> Important: Sometimes if you are changing the `EMCC_CFLAGS` options, Rust won't be clever enough to realise that the build should be cleaned and done again. You may need to manually delete the `emscripten/.rust-build/rust` directory if you get issues when only adjusting the Emscripten build environment properties.

The first part of the Rust build command is to load up the Emscripten SDK environment properties by invoking either `emsdk_env.bat` or `emsdk_env.sh` depending on whether we are in Windows or not.

> Important: Invoking the environment script *must* be done in the same process as the Rust build command otherwise any environment variables it sets will not flow into the Rust build. This is why we use `&` or `&&` to specify a concatenation of commands to run in the same shell process.

The actual Rust build command is then executed in the same shell process and specifies the Emscripten SDK directory as the working directory. You can see we are also using the `.environment` builder method of the `Script` component to specify the `EMCC_CFLAGS` environment property as well.

By the end of the compilation, the Rust build directory will contain `deps/crust.data`, `deps/crust.js` and `deps/crust.wasm` which are all the files we need to bundle and load in a web page to run our application.

Update the `build` method to invoke `compile_application`:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();
    install_rust_dependencies()?;
    configure_emscripten_sdk(context)?;
    compile_application(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Run a build again, you should see a bunch of environment variable and `PATH` property messages and some Rust compiler activity.

> Note: The first time the compiler is run, it may take a long time because Emscripten might need to fetch its SDL ports. Emscripten uses its own ports of SDL internally and is why we don't need to actually do anything related to SDL ourselves to include it in the build chain.

Once the build has completed you should be able to locate the following build output files of interest:

```
+ root
    + emscripten
        + .rust-build
            + rust
                + wasm32-unknown-emscripten
                    + debug
                        + deps
                            - crust.data
                            - crust.js
                            - crust.wasm
```                            

## Create build output

In this step we will collect the `crust.data`, `crust.js` and `crust.wasm` files into the appropriate output directory and generate an `index.html` template to load up `crust.js` and therefore start our application.

Add the following method and constant string:

```rust
fn create_output(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    logs::out(log_tag!(), "Creating output ...");

    let build_variant_dir = context.rust_build_dir.join("wasm32-unknown-emscripten").join(context.variant.id()).join("deps");

    outputs::clean(context)?;
    outputs::collect(
        context,
        vec![
            build_variant_dir.join("crust.wasm"),
            build_variant_dir.join("crust.data"),
            build_variant_dir.join("crust.js"),
        ],
    )?;

    io::write_string(INDEX_HTML_TEMPLATE, &outputs::output_dir(context).join("index.html"))
}

const INDEX_HTML_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
        <style>
            canvas.emscripten {
                display:block;
                border: 0px none;
                background-color: #333333;
            }

            textarea.emscripten {
                resize: none;
                width: 600px;
                height: 200px;
                display:block;
                border: 0px none;
                padding: 8px;
                background-color: #222222;
                color: #ffffff;
                margin: 0px;
            }

            .content {
                border: 1px solid #333333;
                display: inline-block;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div class="content">
            <canvas class="emscripten" id="canvas" width="600", height="360" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()" tabindex=-1></canvas>
            <textarea class="emscripten" id="output" rows="8"></textarea>
        </div>

        <script type='text/javascript'>
            var Module = {
                preRun: [],
                postRun: [],
                print: (function () {
                    var element = document.getElementById('output');
                    if (element) element.value = '';
                    return function (text) {
                        if (arguments.length > 1) {
                            text = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(' ');
                        }

                        console.log(text);

                        if (element) {
                            element.value += text + "\n";
                            element.scrollTop = element.scrollHeight;
                        }
                    };
                })(),
                printErr: function (text) {
                    if (arguments.length > 1) {
                        text = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(' ');
                    }

                    console.error(text);
                },
                canvas: (function () {
                    return document.getElementById('canvas');
                })()
            };
        </script>
        <script async type="text/javascript" src="crust.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
"#;
```

Nothing special here - we are using the `outputs` service we wrote a while ago to *collect* the appropriate build files into the `emscripten/out/<variant>` directory. We are also writing the `INDEX_HTML_TEMPLATE` string to `emscripten/out/<variant>/index.html` via the `io::write_string` method.

Update the `build` method to call this:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();
    install_rust_dependencies()?;
    configure_emscripten_sdk(context)?;
    compile_application(context)?;
    create_output(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Now after running a build you should see the appropriate `out` directory with all the compiled files and the `index.html` in it, like so:

```
+ root
    + emscripten
        + out
            + debug
                - crust.data
                - crust.js
                - crust.wasm
                - index.html
```

## Launch in browser

The `crust` application for Emscripten is actually now built but during development it would be nice to automatically preview the build in a web browser when it is done. To do this we will ask the operating system to open the `http://localhost:8000` url which (hopefully) should launch the default web browser.

We will also start the `https` utility we installed earlier to serve up the content in the output directory, such that `index.html` will be loaded.

Add the following method (I put it above the `INDEX_HTML_TEMPLATE` constant):

```rust
fn open_in_browser(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    let launch_command = if cfg!(target_os = "windows") { "start" } else { "open" };

    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!("{} http://localhost:8000", &launch_command)))?;
    scripts::run(&Script::new("http -p 8000").working_dir(&outputs::output_dir(context)))
}
```

Update the `build` method to call it:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();
    install_rust_dependencies()?;
    configure_emscripten_sdk(context)?;
    compile_application(context)?;
    create_output(context)?;
    open_in_browser(context)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Awesome, do another build and now a basic web server will start:

```
Hosting "." on port 8000 without TLS and no authentication...
Ctrl-C to stop.
```

And your web browser should open:

<img src="/images/crust/part-09/emscripten-broken.png" />

> Note: If you don't see something like above you may need to press the refresh button as the browser may have been faster than the local web server starting up.

That doesn't look right! What is going on here? The warning message in the browser window is telling us something doesn't seem right - the reason is because our traditional main loop is executing continually at very high speed and not yielding to the host web browser - in fact on my old Mac computer this even caused my fans to start going crazy!

In Emscripten our code needs to create and run a *main loop* very differently than for a traditional application. 
We are going to need to update some code in `crust-main` to fix this. Close the browser window and cancel the running web server (`CTRL-C`). From this point we will be editing source files in the `crust-main` project instead of `crust-build`.

## Emscripten main loop

Previously in [Part 5 - Init SDL](/crust/2022/02/07/part-05/) we introduced the `core/launcher.rs` code and I mentioned that although it wasn't obvious at the time, there was a reason for keeping it in its own file.

Well, the reason is because for the Emscripten target we will be implementing a completely different launcher and we will *conditionally* compile the Emscripten version for the Emscripten target and the existing version for everything else.

We have already used [conditional code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html) to do certain things differently on Windows, for example this kind of code would run `emsdk_env.bat` on Windows, otherwise `./emsdk_env.sh`:

```rust
let script_prefix = if cfg!(target_os = "windows") {
    "emsdk_env.bat &"
} else {
    ". ./emsdk_env.sh &&"
};
```

We can also use conditional properties to control which *source* files are included too, by writing conditional statement inside `use` statements and `mod` files.

Let's create a stub for our Emscripten launcher, then update the existing code to *conditionally* compile it for Emscripten. Create `core/launcher_emscripten.rs` - remember we are now working in the `crust-main` project. You can leave the new file empty for a moment.

Now, update `core/mod.rs` and change how the existing `launcher` module is included, and add a new entry for `launcher_emscripten`:

```rust
pub mod display_size;
pub mod engine;
pub mod failable;
pub mod failable_unit;
pub mod graphics;
pub mod io;
pub mod logs;
pub mod main_loop;
pub mod renderer;
pub mod scene;
pub mod window;

#[cfg(not(target_os = "emscripten"))]
pub mod launcher;

#[cfg(target_os = "emscripten")]
pub mod launcher_emscripten;
```

Note how we use the `cfg` statements to *conditionally* include either `launcher` *or* `launcher_emscripten`. At the moment you would still be able to run on Windows or MacOS, but if we try to compile the Emscripten target now you will see a compilation error like this:

```
cargo run -- --target emscripten --variant debug

...

error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `launcher` in `core`
  --> src/lib.rs:10:36
   |
10 |     std::process::exit(match core::launcher::launch() {
   |                                    ^^^^^^^^ could not find `launcher` in `core`
```

This is because `core::launcher::launch` was not compiled into the Emscripten target, so Rust has no idea what it is. To fix this issue we'll update `lib.rs` to also conditionally run either the `launcher` or `launcher_emscripten` code. Update `lib.rs`:

```rust
pub mod components;
pub mod core;
pub mod log_tag;
pub mod opengl;
pub mod scenes;

use crate::core::{failable_unit::FailableUnit, logs};

pub fn main() {
    std::process::exit(match launch() {
        Ok(_) => 0,

```

We've introduced two versions of a `launch` method - each one delegating to the correct `launcher` code and each one conditionally compiled in. We tweaked the `main` method to now call this `launch` method, instead of directly calling `core::launcher::launch()`. Of course, if we compile for Emscripten again we still have an error to resolve:

```
error[E0425]: cannot find function `launch` in module `core::launcher_emscripten`
  --> src/lib.rs:26:32
   |
26 |     core::launcher_emscripten::launch()
   |                                ^^^^^^ not found in `core::launcher_emscripten`
```

Hopefully this error should be obvious - we haven't actually written the `launch` method in our Emscripten launcher so of course it will cause a compilation error. Edit `launcher_emscripten.rs`:

```rust
use crate::{
    core::{failable::Failable, failable_unit::FailableUnit, main_loop::MainLoop},
    opengl::opengl_engine::OpenGLEngine,
};
use std::{cell::RefCell, os::raw::c_int, rc::Rc};

pub fn launch() -> FailableUnit {
    LAUNCHER.with(|it| it.set_main_loop())
}

// We need to hold the data structures statically so we can bind the Emscripten C method callbacks. The static
// instances behave like lazy singletons - the `MAIN_LOOP` is never accessed *before* the `LAUNCHER` is, so there
// won't be any issues around order of initialization.
thread_local!(static LAUNCHER: EmscriptenLauncher = EmscriptenLauncher::new().unwrap());
thread_local!(static MAIN_LOOP: RefCell<MainLoop<OpenGLEngine>> = LAUNCHER.with(|it| RefCell::new(it.new_main_loop().unwrap())));

// This invokes our main loop within our LAUNCHER singleton and is declared as a function that can be called from
// C, allowing us to pass it to Emscripten as the 'main loop' callback. There is an alternate method available that
// takes a single argument cast as `void*` type but it starts to get pretty awful trying to coerce our Rust objects
// into and out of void pointers to be able to pass them through so we'll stick with the (admittedly less than ideal)
// singleton approach so the `MAIN_LOOP` doesn't need to be passed in as an argument.
extern "C" fn run_main_loop() {
    MAIN_LOOP.with(|it| it.borrow_mut().run().unwrap());
}

extern "C" {
    // This is the alias for the Emscripten C function which associates a callback to execute on every
    // iteration of the main loop: https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop
    fn emscripten_set_main_loop(func: unsafe extern "C" fn(), fps: c_int, simulate_infinite_loop: c_int);
}

struct EmscriptenLauncher {
    pub sdl: Rc<sdl2::Sdl>,
}

impl EmscriptenLauncher {
    pub fn new() -> Failable<Self> {
        let sdl = Rc::new(sdl2::init()?);
        sdl2::image::init(sdl2::image::InitFlag::PNG)?;

        Ok(EmscriptenLauncher { sdl: sdl })
    }

    pub fn new_main_loop(&self) -> Failable<MainLoop<OpenGLEngine>> {
        MainLoop::new(&self.sdl, OpenGLEngine::new(&self.sdl)?)
    }

    fn set_main_loop(&self) -> FailableUnit {
        unsafe {
            emscripten_set_main_loop(run_main_loop, 0, 1);
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Ok, there is a fair bit to unpack here and I'll do my best to describe what is going on. In Emscripten we need to invoke a `C` API method to define which method to call as the *main loop*. The underlying Emscripten implementation will call this method on each cycle, then yield to the host web browser. This allows an Emscripten application to play nicely with the browser and share its runtime. Here is the [Emscripten main loop documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop).

The main loop method we need to pass to Emscripten needs to be somewhat static in nature so it doesn't fall out of scope and get destroyed while Emscripten is trying to call into it from the browser context. This is because Rust can't see any external Emscripten code and won't know that something outside its managed state needs our main loop data to stay alive.

Rust doesn't allow `static` objects that are lazily instantiated in the way other languages might but we can achieve a similar outcome by using the [thread_local! macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.thread_local.html) which ultimately automates the creation of a [LocalKey](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html).

We must be careful that the object is created scoped to the *thread* it is in but for the single main loop code in Emscripten this shouldn't cause us issues. The other nice thing is that the object held is only instantiated the first time something tries to use it.

> Note: There are third party crates that can help with dynamically initialised static objects in Rust such as the [static_init crate](https://crates.io/crates/static_init) - I actually used this crate originally but I wanted to try and use the least number of third party libraries as possible, so I swapped it out for the standard library `thread_local! + LocalKey` approach instead. The `static_init` crate did work really well though, if you want to go that way.

The `MAIN_LOOP` object when accessed will cause the `LAUNCHER` object to be instantiated, creating a new instance of `EmscriptenLauncher` which initialises SDL - this is one of the rare places we are using an `.unwrap()`.

The stored `LAUNCHER` object (which is an instance of the `EmscriptenLauncher` structure) is passed into the `with` lambda and is set to a container holding an instance of our `MainLoop` structure, created via the `it.new_main_loop()` invocation.

We hold the main loop inside a [RefCell](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html) container - which is like a `Box` container, except that the object inside it is *mutable* (an object inside a `Box` is *immutable*). We need the main loop object to be mutable because its `run` method mutates data inside it when invoked.

```rust
thread_local!(static LAUNCHER: EmscriptenLauncher = EmscriptenLauncher::new().unwrap());
thread_local!(static MAIN_LOOP: RefCell<MainLoop<OpenGLEngine>> = LAUNCHER.with(|it| RefCell::new(it.new_main_loop().unwrap())));
```

The actual code that triggers this in our `lib.rs` is:

```rust
pub fn launch() -> FailableUnit {
    LAUNCHER.with(|it| it.set_main_loop())
}
```

When the `LAUNCHER` object is access via `with`, the whole sequence of events kicks off.

The code inside `set_main_loop` needs a bit of explanation. Firstly we need to define a method that can be called **from** external `C` code - this is the method that Emscripten will invoke in each cycle. We do this using the `extern "C" fn run_main_loop()` method signature. This exposes a method named `run_main_loop` which can be called from outside our code and will tell the `MAIN_LOOP` object to invoke its `run` method:

```rust
extern "C" fn run_main_loop() {
    MAIN_LOOP.with(|it| it.borrow_mut().run().unwrap());
}
```

Next we need to define a signature which maps to an external `C` method so we can invoke it from our Rust code - in this case we would be invoking the external `emscripten_set_main_loop` in the underlying Emscripten framework.

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn emscripten_set_main_loop(func: unsafe extern "C" fn(), fps: c_int, simulate_infinite_loop: c_int);
}
```

The `set_main_loop` method in our `EmscriptenLauncher` code will invoke the **external** `emscripten_set_main_loop` function, passing our `run_main_loop` method as the first argument. From this point Emscripten will start calling `run_main_loop` via the `C` interop which therefore executes our Rust code on each frame cycle.

```rust
fn set_main_loop(&self) -> FailableUnit {
    unsafe {
        emscripten_set_main_loop(run_main_loop, 0, 1);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

The [Emscripten main loop documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop) has more detailed info about how this works and what the other arguments do.

Ok cool, try to run the Emscripten build again - this time you should see the scene appear and be able to move around with the keyboard (you need to click the scene to give it focus first).

Although this is pretty good, there is still one minor problem to fix which might not be obvious. If you look at the image below you can see to the lower right hand side there is a larger amount of empty space:

<img src="/images/crust/part-09/emscripten-bad-display-size.png" />

This is because currently the 3D scene is hard coded in our engine to render at `640x480` because of the display size value returned by the `get_size` method inside `crust-main/src/core/window.rs`. However if you check our `index.html` file we are actually embedding the 3D scene at `600x360` so it seems our scene is not rendering at the size our HTML document has defined.

To fix this issue we need to update the `core/window.rs` file in `crust-main` to have an Emscripten specific implementation of `get_size`, which calls some Javascript code in the browser to ask for the correct size.

Edit `core/window.rs` to have and Emscripten and a non Emscripten implementation:

```rust
use crate::core::{display_size::DisplaySize, failable::Failable};

#[cfg(not(target_os = "emscripten"))]
pub fn get_size(video: &sdl2::VideoSubsystem) -> Failable<DisplaySize> {
    let mut width = 640i32;
    let mut height = 480i32;

    if cfg!(target_os = "android") || cfg!(target_os = "ios") {
        let display_mode = video.desktop_display_mode(0)?;
        width = display_mode.w;
        height = display_mode.h;
    }

    Ok(DisplaySize {
        width: width,
        height: height,
    })
}

#[cfg(target_os = "emscripten")]
pub fn get_size(_: &sdl2::VideoSubsystem) -> Failable<DisplaySize> {
    use std::os::raw::{c_char, c_int};

    extern "C" {
        fn emscripten_run_script_int(code: *const c_char) -> c_int;
    }

    unsafe {
        let width: i32 = emscripten_run_script_int(b"document.getElementById('canvas').width;\0" as *const _ as *const c_char)
            .try_into()
            .map_err(|_| "Failed to get HTML canvas width!")?;

        let height: i32 = emscripten_run_script_int(b"document.getElementById('canvas').height;\0" as *const _ as *const c_char)
            .try_into()
            .map_err(|_| "Failed to get HTML canvas height!")?;

        Ok(DisplaySize {
            width: width,
            height: height,
        })
    }
}
```

We have kept the original `get_size` method but wrapped it with `#[cfg(not(target_os = "emscripten"))]` and added a new Emscripten version. In the Emscripten version we are declaring the external `emscripten_run_script_int` signature, which lives outside our application code and using it to execute blocks of Javascript to fetch the `width` and `height` of the `canvas` HTML element.

Run the application again and the 3D scene should be rendering at the expected `600x360` size. Additionally, if we had set the `canvas` object to be a dynamic size this would also fix any problems related to the browser window being resized at runtime:

## Summary

Dealing with Emscripten is a bit rough but getting this working in Rust does seem overall to be a bit cleaner than with C/C++, though it is likely to be more susceptible to breaking changes in the Rust toolchain over time.

In the next article we will implement the Android target - it will be a bit of a beast but we gotta wrangle it some time!
