In this article we will create a new Xcode project and implement the `crust-build` pipeline for building the MacOS Dekstop target platform. This will let us run `crust` as a bundled MacOS application - such that it could also be published to the Apple Mac App Store - though you would need an active Apple Developer subscription to do that. We will:

- Create a new Xcode MacOS Desktop project which invokes `crust-build` as part of its build pipeline
- Fill in the implementation of the MacOS Desktop build target in our `crust-build` project

## Xcode project

You may recall that for the MacOS Console application we didn't create an Xcode project at all, instead just running `crust` from a directory that knew where to find the appropriate SDL frameworks and assets. For the MacOS Desktop target however, we will take an approach similar to Android where we create a project in the native tooling (Xcode in this case) which will invoke our `crust-build` as part of its build pipeline.

Start off by creating a new directory named `macos-desktop` in your `crust` workspace, so you have a structure like:

```
+ root
    + android
    + crust-build
    + crust-main
    + macos-desktop
```

**Create Xcode project**

Launch Xcode and create a new MacOS app project:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-01.png"/>

Set the project name to `crust` and pick the settings shown below.

> Note: There is no need to include Swift support as we will barely write any Apple code.

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-02.png"/>

Save the new project in your `macos-desktop` directory, afterward you should have:

```
+ root
    ...
    + macos-desktop
        + crust
            + crust
            + crust.xcodeproj
```

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-03.png"/>

**Delete unwanted files**

As we aren't authoring an Apple UI application we can get rid of a bunch of files that won't be needed. Delete the following files from the project (choose `Move To Trash` when asked):

- `AppDelegate.h`
- `AppDelegate.m`
- `ViewController.h`
- `ViewController.m`
- `Main.storyboard`

Delete the `Main` from the `Main Interface` field in the `Deployment Info` section also:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-04.png"/>

**Build script**

We are going to be compiling and building our Rust code into a `crust` binary file, which will be bundled into the output of the Xcode project. To do this, we'll invoke our `crust-build` command as an Xcode build phase using a basic Xcode driven shell script. Navigate to the `Build Phases` section of the `crust` target and add a `New Run Script Phase`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-05.png"/>

Drag the new `Run Script` step as far to the top as possible - just under the `Dependencies` step, uncheck the `Based on dependency analysis` checkbox, then enter the following script:

```sh
set -e
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin"
cd "$SRCROOT/../../crust-build"
cargo run -- --target macos-desktop --variant $CONFIGURATION
```

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-06.png"/>

When running shell scripts from Xcode we don't get anything that might usually be set through `.bashrc`, `.bash.profile` or `.zshrc`. This means that by default the `PATH` environment variable won't contain the location of `homebrew` or any of its installed packages such as `xcodegen`, which we need in order to build the SDL frameworks.

To work around this problem we need to explicitly set the `PATH` environment variable ourselves and include the typical locations of the binary tools needed in the shell script. For `crust-build` this means knowing the location of the `xcodegen` tool and the `cargo` command which resides by default at `~/.cargo/bin/`.

After setting the correct `PATH` we change into the `crust-build` directory and run the typical `cargo` command to build the `macos-desktop` Rust target. The `$CONFIGURATION` property is provided into the shell environment by Xcode itself and will be either `Debug` or `Release` - this was one of the reasons for allowing the `--variant` argument to be case insensitive within `crust-build`.

If you run the project and go to the build output in the `Report navigator` pane you can see that our `crust-build` code was invoked, though we still have to implement the actual build code for the `macos-desktop` target in `crust-build`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-07.png"/>

## Rust build implementation

The code we have to add in `crust-build` is actually quite small. We will also be able to reuse the SDL framework code from our MacOS Console target that we wrote at the start of the series to save us some effort. Update `crust-build/src/macos_desktop.rs` with:

```rust
use crate::{
    core::{context::Context, failable_unit::FailableUnit, io, logs, script::Script, scripts},
    log_tag, macos_sdl,
};
use std::path::PathBuf;

const ARCHITECTURE_X86_64: &str = "x86_64-apple-darwin";
const ARCHITECTURE_ARM64: &str = "aarch64-apple-darwin";

pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    context.print_summary();

    install_rust_dependencies()?;

    let frameworks_dir = macos_sdl::setup(context)?;
    link_frameworks(context, &frameworks_dir)?;
    compile(context)?;
    create_output(context)?;

    Ok(())
}

fn install_rust_dependencies() -> FailableUnit {
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!("rustup target add {} {}", ARCHITECTURE_X86_64, ARCHITECTURE_ARM64)))
}

fn link_frameworks(context: &Context, frameworks_dir: &PathBuf) -> FailableUnit {
    io::create_symlink(frameworks_dir, &context.target_home_dir.join("crust").join("Frameworks"), &context.working_dir)
}

fn compile(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    for architecture in &vec![ARCHITECTURE_X86_64, ARCHITECTURE_ARM64] {
        logs::out(log_tag!(), &format!("Compiling architecture: {} ...", &architecture));

        scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!(
            "cargo rustc {} --manifest-path {:?} --target {} --bin crust --target-dir {:?} -- -L framework={:?}",
            context.variant.rust_compiler_flag(),
            context.source_dir.join("Cargo.toml"),
            &architecture,
            context.rust_build_dir,
            context.working_dir.join("Frameworks"),
        )))?;
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn create_output(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    let output_binary_dir = context.target_home_dir.join("crust").join("crust");
    let x86_64_binary = context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_X86_64).join(context.variant.id()).join("crust");
    let arm64_binary = context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_ARM64).join(context.variant.id()).join("crust");

    scripts::run(
        &Script::new(&format!("lipo -create -output crust {:?} {:?}", &x86_64_binary, &arm64_binary))
            .working_dir(&output_binary_dir),
    )?;

    scripts::run(&Script::new("install_name_tool -add_rpath @loader_path/../Frameworks crust").working_dir(&output_binary_dir))
}
```

**Install rust dependencies**

Installs the Rust toolchains for `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `aarch64-apple-darwin` - this is so we can build a `crust` binary that is compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon hardware:

```rust
fn install_rust_dependencies() -> FailableUnit {
    scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!("rustup target add {} {}", ARCHITECTURE_X86_64, ARCHITECTURE_ARM64)))
}
```

**Setup SDL**

The setup of the SDL2 and SDL2 Image frameworks is done using our shared `macos_sdl::setup` code from our MacOS Console implementation - the same frameworks can be used for the MacOS Desktop target as well:

```rust
pub fn build(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    ...
    let frameworks_dir = macos_sdl::setup(context)?;
```

**Link SDL frameworks**

Creates a symlink to the compiled SDL frameworks within the Xcode project directory structure - we will add the symlinked `Frameworks` directory to the Xcode project soon.

```rust
fn link_frameworks(context: &Context, frameworks_dir: &PathBuf) -> FailableUnit {
    io::create_symlink(frameworks_dir, &context.target_home_dir.join("crust").join("Frameworks"), &context.working_dir)
}
```

We would end up with a symlink directory like this:

```
+ root
    + macos-desktop
        + crust
            + Frameworks
```

**Compile Rust code**

Compiles our `crust-main` Rust code into both the `x86_64` and `aarch64` architectures. Note that we pass the `-L framework={:?}` argument to link against the compiled SDL frameworks:

```rust
fn compile(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    for architecture in &vec![ARCHITECTURE_X86_64, ARCHITECTURE_ARM64] {
        logs::out(log_tag!(), &format!("Compiling architecture: {} ...", &architecture));

        scripts::run(&Script::new(&format!(
            "cargo rustc {} --manifest-path {:?} --target {} --bin crust --target-dir {:?} -- -L framework={:?}",
            context.variant.rust_compiler_flag(),
            context.source_dir.join("Cargo.toml"),
            &architecture,
            context.rust_build_dir,
            context.working_dir.join("Frameworks"),
        )))?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Create output**

We use the `lipo` tool to combine the `x86_64` and `aarch64` binaries into a single *universal binary* named `crust`. The binary is then placed into the Xcode project directory structure so it can be bundled into the Xcode build. We then update it using `install_name_tool` to help it find the `Frameworks` relative to itself.

```rust
fn create_output(context: &Context) -> FailableUnit {
    let output_binary_dir = context.target_home_dir.join("crust").join("crust");
    let x86_64_binary = context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_X86_64).join(context.variant.id()).join("crust");
    let arm64_binary = context.rust_build_dir.join(ARCHITECTURE_ARM64).join(context.variant.id()).join("crust");

    scripts::run(
        &Script::new(&format!("lipo -create -output crust {:?} {:?}", &x86_64_binary, &arm64_binary))
            .working_dir(&output_binary_dir),
    )?;

    scripts::run(&Script::new("install_name_tool -add_rpath @loader_path/../Frameworks crust").working_dir(&output_binary_dir))
}
```

Save `macos_desktop.rs` and go back to Xcode. Run the Xcode project again and this time you will see our `crust-build` building the SDL frameworks and compiling our Rust code:

```

It may take a while to complete for the first time as it is building the SDL frameworks - just like for the MacOS Console project. When it is complete you should now see a `Frameworks` directory, a `Frameworks` symlink and a `crust` binary file like so:

```
+ root
    + macos-desktop
        + .rust-build
            + Frameworks
                + SDL2_image.framework
                + SDL2.framework
                ...
        + crust
            + crust
                - crust (universal binary file)
            ...
            + Frameworks (symlink)
```

Although there are a lot of `crust` directory and file names, the universal binary of our Rust code is in `macos-desktop/crust/crust/crust`. The `macos-desktop/crust/Frameworks` is a symlink pointing at `macos-desktop/.rust-build/Frameworks`.

## Add generated files to Xcode project

The Rust build code is now done, the remaining steps are to add the outputs of our Rust build as members of the Xcode project.

**Assets**

To bundle our 3D models, textures and shaders we'll add the `assets` directory as a reference to the Xcode project. Right click on the `crust` project directory and choose `Add Files to "crust"`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-08.png"/>

Navigate and select `crust-main/assets`, make sure to add it as a *reference* and leave the `Copy items if needed` unselected:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-09.png"/>

You should end up with a blue folder named `assets` in Xcode. By default, the content of this folder will be bundled into the resources of the Xcode app during the build, making them available to `crust`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-10.png"/>

**Frameworks**

We will now add the required frameworks to the Xcode project. Start off by adding the `OpenGL.framework` that is available from Apple:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-11.png"/>

After adding it, leave the `Embed` setting as `Do Not Embed` - there is no need to bundle OpenGL support explicitly:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-12.png"/>

Next we will add the SDL frameworks which we compiled ourselves and that are stored in the `Frameworks` symlink directory. Add a new framework and select `Add Other` -> `Add Files` in the dialog:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-13.png"/>

Navigate into the `Frameworks` symlink directory and select the `SDL2.framework` and `SDL2_image.framework` directories as shown and add them:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-14.png"/>

Leave the new frameworks as `Embed & Sign`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-15.png"/>

We also need to update the Xcode build setting which defines where to look for frameworks during compilation. Navigate to the `Build Settings` tab and find the `Framework Search Paths` field. Add a new entry with `$(SRCROOT)/Frameworks` - Xcode will resolve `$(SRCROOT)` to being the source root of our project:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-framework-search-path.png"/>

**Universal binary**

Ok so we now have our assets and frameworks in the project, the last thing is to add the `crust` universal binary and update the bootstrap code to launch it in its main process. Right click on the `crust` folder in the Xcode project and choose `Add Files to "crust"`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-16.png"/>

Select the `crust` file at `macos-desktop/crust/crust/crust` - leave `Copy items if needed` disabled:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-17.png"/>

You should now have the `crust` universal binary as a member of the Xcode project:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/xcode-step-18.png"/>

Next up we need to update `main.m` to load up the universal binary file and execute it. Replace the content of `main.m` with:

```objectivec
#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    NSTask *task = [NSTask new];
    task.launchPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"crust" ofType:nil];
    [task launch];
    [task waitUntilExit];
}
```

The code here creates a new `NSTask` and tells it to launch the `crust` binary in the bundled resources. It then performs a `waitUntilExit` command on the task, effectively letting `crust` loop continually until it signals it is finished.

## Drum roll!

Alrighty - run the project again and now you should see `crust` in all its glory!

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/complete.png"/>

You can find the fully bundled MacOS Desktop application at `DerivedData/crust/Build/Products/Debug/crust.app`:

<img src="/images/crust/part-11/bundle.png"/>

You can actually copy `crust.app` and run it as a self contained program from anywhere. If you wanted to make an archive release build you would need an Apple Developer account but I'll leave that to you.

## Git ignore

Before we finish we'll add a Git ignore rule so we don't commit the `crust` universal binary file to version control - there is no need as it is automatically generated when we do a build. Add a new file `macos-desktop/crust/crust/.gitignore` with the following:

```
/crust
```

> Note: We already put Git ignore rules in earlier to ignore `DerivedData`, `xcuserdata` and a few other directory names so we only need to add this specific rule for the universal binary file.

## Summary

Awesome, we have one more target to go - iOS!
