While the Vulkan swapchain was a difficult component to implement, it gives us the prequisites for some of the remaining components needed to form a renderer. In this article we will progress through the following topics:

- Adding a new *render context* class to represent the orchestration of Vulkan components for the purpose of a render loop.
- Creating a Vulkan *render pass* - this is the definition of how to perform the graphical operations during a rendering sequence: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkRenderPass](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkRenderPass).

## Render context class

The main render loop for Vulkan is composed of the interactions between a number of different Vulkan components. We will go into detail about these interactions over the next few articles as we write the rest of the rendering code.

Having a *render context* class which is separate from our Vulkan *context* class allows us to encapsulate all the potentially volatile rendering components together - making it easier to *recreate* them in situations where they become invalid. One such scenario where the rendering components become invalid is if the size of the application window surface changes. I'll cover the recreation topic in more depth in a subsequent article. For now we will focus on authoring a basic *render context* class.

Create `vulkan-render-context.hpp` and `vulkan-render-context.cpp` in `application/vulkan`. Enter the following into the header:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"
#include "../../core/sdl-window.hpp"
#include "vulkan-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-physical-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-surface.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanRenderContext
    {
        VulkanRenderContext(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
                            const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                            const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                            const ast::VulkanSurface& surface);

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

Initially the *render context* will need the related components required to create a swapchain as this class will now become the owner of the swapchain.

Enter the following into the implementation:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-render-context.hpp"
#include "vulkan-swapchain.hpp"

using ast::VulkanRenderContext;

struct VulkanRenderContext::Internal
{
    const ast::VulkanSwapchain swapchain;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : swapchain(ast::VulkanSwapchain(window, physicalDevice, device, surface)) {}
};

VulkanRenderContext::VulkanRenderContext(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
                                         const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                         const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                         const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
    : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>(window, physicalDevice, device, surface)) {}
```

The implementation is quite straight forward - really it is just creating and holding a swapchain instance. We will add more components during this article.

Our Vulkan *context* class will hold an instance of our new render context and will no longer directly create the swapchain itself. Edit `vulkan-context.cpp` and exchange the swapchain header for our new render context header:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-swapchain.hpp"
```

becomes:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-render-context.hpp"
```

Replace the existing swapchain member field and construction code with a `VulkanRenderContext` instead:

```cpp
struct VulkanContext::Internal
{
    ...
    const ast::VulkanSwapchain swapchain;

    Internal() : ...
                 swapchain(ast::VulkanSwapchain(window, physicalDevice, device, surface))
```

becomes:

```cpp
struct VulkanContext::Internal
{
    ...
    const ast::VulkanRenderContext renderContext;

    Internal() : ...
                 renderContext(ast::VulkanRenderContext(window, physicalDevice, device, surface))
```

Run the application to make sure it still works the same way as before.

## Render pass prerequisites

I would *highly* recommend reading the following links about render passes - what they are for and an overview of their behaviours:

- [https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-renderpasses/](https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-renderpasses/)
- [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Render_passes](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Render_passes)

We must have a render pass otherwise we won't really be able to render anything. There are some prerequisite bits of information we need to create our render pass - some of which we already have in our Vulkan implementation and some which we'll need to introduce in this article. In particular we will need:

- **Swapchain colour format**: The colour format of the swapchain that will be used to present the output of the render pass.
- **Multi sampling level**: Also known as anti aliasing - will help to smooth out jagged visual artifacts on edges of rendered geometry.
- **Depth testing format**: The colour format to perform depth testing with - this is explained fairly well in the following article: [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering).

**Swapchain colour format**

We already have the colour format for our swapchain held privately in the `VulkanSwapchainFormat format` field inside `vulkan-swapchain.cpp`. All we need to do is add a way to *get* the colour format publicly. Open `vulkan-swapchain.hpp` and add a new public function definition:

```cpp
namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanSwapchain
    {
        ...
        const vk::Format& getColorFormat() const;
        ...
```

In `vulkan-swapchain.cpp` add the implementation of this new function to return the `colorFormat` component of the internal `format` field:

```cpp
const vk::Format& VulkanSwapchain::getColorFormat() const
{
    return internal->format.colorFormat;
}
```

**Multi sampling level**

The multi sampling level - or *anti aliasing* level as it is also known - comes from our *physical device*. We will choose a multi sampling level by querying the properties of the physical device we chose during initialisation. We will have to write some extra code in our physical device class to achieve this.

Open `vulkan-physical-device.hpp` and add a new function definition to expose the multi sampling level that can be used. Note that it is of the type `vk::SampleCountFlagBits` which is an enumeration of all the possible values - the multi sampling level isn't simply a number:

```cpp
vk::SampleCountFlagBits getMultiSamplingLevel() const;
```

Since we can compute this value when initialising the physical device, we'll add a new field to the internal implementation - edit `vulkan-physical-device.cpp` and add the following field and constructor code into the `Internal` struct:

```cpp
struct VulkanPhysicalDevice::Internal
{
    ...
    const vk::SampleCountFlagBits multiSamplingLevel;

    Internal(const vk::Instance& instance)
        : ...
          multiSamplingLevel(::getMultiSamplingLevel(physicalDevice)) {}
```

Add the `<stack>` header at the top of our file to allow us to use a `std::stack` component:

```cpp
#include <stack>
```

Now jump to the anonymous namespace and write a new free function named `getMultiSamplingLevel`:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    vk::SampleCountFlagBits getMultiSamplingLevel(const vk::PhysicalDevice& physicalDevice)
    {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice::getMultiSamplingLevel"};

        vk::PhysicalDeviceProperties properties{physicalDevice.getProperties()};
        vk::SampleCountFlags supportedSampleCounts{properties.limits.framebufferColorSampleCounts};

        std::stack<vk::SampleCountFlagBits> preferredSampleCounts;
        preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e1);
        preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e2);
        preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e4);
        preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e8);

        while (!preferredSampleCounts.empty())
        {
            // Take the sample count at the top of the stack and see if it is supported.
            vk::SampleCountFlagBits sampleCount{preferredSampleCounts.top()};

            if (supportedSampleCounts & sampleCount)
            {
                return sampleCount;
            }

            // If our preferred sample count is not found, pop the stack ready for the next iteration.
            preferredSampleCounts.pop();
        }

        // If none of our sample counts is found, multi sampling is not supported on this device ...
        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": Multi sampling not supported.");
    }
}
```

We start off by obtaining the physical device properties then querying them for the `framebufferColorSampleCounts` limit:

```cpp
vk::SampleCountFlagBits getMultiSamplingLevel(const vk::PhysicalDevice& physicalDevice)
{
    static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice::getMultiSamplingLevel"};

    vk::PhysicalDeviceProperties properties{physicalDevice.getProperties()};
    vk::SampleCountFlags supportedSampleCounts{properties.limits.framebufferColorSampleCounts};
```

We then create a *stack* which holds our preferred levels of multi sampling to allow us to pop each one looking for matching support. Note that I've only gone as high as multi sampling level of 8 which is reasonably high on most average hardware. You could try to go higher if desired or make it configurable by a user so they could choose instead but we will simply use the highest available multi sampling level if it's supported up to a maximum of `e8`:

```cpp
std::stack<vk::SampleCountFlagBits> preferredSampleCounts;
preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e1);
preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e2);
preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e4);
preferredSampleCounts.push(vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e8);
```

> Note: High multi sampling levels can impact performance. You may find that low end platforms such as mobile devices might perform better with lower multi sampling levels at the cost of image quality.

The stack is then walked, popping and checking each element until we find a supported multi sampling count or don't find any. It would be very unlikely (not sure if it's even possible) to not have at least `e1` support, but our code will cope regardless. If we find a match we return it and we are done. You might remember we took a similar approach when writing the swapchain to choose a presentation mode:

```cpp
while (!preferredSampleCounts.empty())
{
    // Take the sample count at the top of the stack and see if it is supported.
    vk::SampleCountFlagBits sampleCount{preferredSampleCounts.top()};

    if (supportedSampleCounts & sampleCount)
    {
        return sampleCount;
    }

    // If our preferred sample count is not found, pop the stack ready for the next iteration.
    preferredSampleCounts.pop();
}
```

Of course if our entire stack is exhausted and no match was found, then ultimately we can't use Vulkan on whatever device this is:

```cpp
throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": Multi sampling not supported.");
```

**Depth testing format**

We need to supply the render pass with the colour format to apply when performing depth testing. The article I mentioned earlier here [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering) explains a lot about this topic. We will be choosing to use the `VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT` format for depth testing exposed to us via the Vulkan C++ header as `vk::Format::eD32Sfloat`.

All the Vulkan formats are described here: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkFormat.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkFormat.html). Searching that site for `VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT` produces the following definition:

> "VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT specifies a one-component, 32-bit signed floating-point format that has 32-bits in the depth component."

We will need to check if the format is supported by our physical device before assuming it is available then keep it as a field within our `vulkan-physical-device` class for easy reference. Edit `vulkan-physical-device.hpp` and add the following function definition to allow other code to ask for the depth format:

```cpp
vk::Format getDepthFormat() const;
```

Update `vulkan-physical-device.cpp`, adding a new member field named `depthFormat`, initialising it via the `getDepthFormat` function:

```cpp
struct VulkanPhysicalDevice::Internal
{
    ...
    const vk::Format depthFormat;

    Internal(const vk::Instance& instance)
        : ...
          depthFormat(::getDepthFormat(physicalDevice)) {}
```

Next, add the `getDepthFormat` free function into the anonymous namespace:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    vk::Format getDepthFormat(const vk::PhysicalDevice& physicalDevice)
    {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice::getDepthFormat"};

        vk::FormatProperties formatProperties{physicalDevice.getFormatProperties(vk::Format::eD32Sfloat)};

        if (formatProperties.optimalTilingFeatures & vk::FormatFeatureFlagBits::eDepthStencilAttachment)
        {
            return vk::Format::eD32Sfloat;
        }

        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": 32 bit signed depth stencil format not supported.");
    }
}
```

This function firstly fetches the `formatProperties` for the given physical device that are specific to the `eD32Sfloat` format which is the one we want to use for depth testing. It then checks if the format properties has the `eDepthStencilAttachment` capability which is required to use the format for depth testing. If support is not found, we throw an exception.

Lastly we need to add the public function implementation to the bottom of `vulkan-physical-device.cpp`:

```cpp
vk::Format VulkanPhysicalDevice::getDepthFormat() const
{
    return internal->depthFormat;
}
```

## Creating the render pass

We now have all the components needed to instantiate a render pass. A render pass is comprised of one or more `vk::AttachmentDescription` configurations, each having a corresponding `vk::AttachmentReference`. The attachment references are then fed into a *subpass* which is what the render pass object will execute during rendering. We will also define a `vk::SubpassDependency` configuration to describe the relationship between the subpasses. This is particularly important when we have more than one subpass in the same render pass instance - though we will just have one subpass for this article.

Our render pass will have the following:

- A **colour attachment** describing the configuration for the *colour* output.
- A **depth testing attachment** describing the configuration for how to apply *depth testing* - this is what determines whether to draw pixels in front of other pixels or not.
- A **multi sampling attachment** describing the configuration for how to apply *multi sampling* - when applied, this will take the output and use multi sampling to smooth out the jaggies.
- A **subpass** which stitches together the attachments into a single *subpass* configuration.
- A **subpass dependency** which declares the rules for processing the subpass. For our use case it is fairly simple as we only have one subpass to consider.
- A **render pass** configuration which pulls together all of the other configurations to ultimately generate a new `vk::UniqueRenderPass` instance - we will store the resulting render pass instance as an internal field.

If you feel lost here don't fret - I found (still finding!!) the relationships between these attachments and subpasses to be quite challenging to sink into my brain. The following site describes a lot about the subpass system: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSubpassDescription.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSubpassDescription.html).

The main thing is that a render pass can have one or more *subpasses*, and the *subpasses* are the actual stages of operations that will be performed during rendering. A *subpass* itself can have different kinds of attachments - *colour*, *depth testing* and *multi sampling* (syntactically this is called the *resolve attachment* as it resolves the final state of the output image and may not necessarily be due to multi sampling).

With all that said, we will now stand up a new class to encapsulate the render pass. Create `vulkan-render-pass.hpp` and `vulkan-render-pass.cpp` in `application/vulkan`. Edit the header with the following:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"
#include "vulkan-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-physical-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-swapchain.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanRenderPass
    {
        VulkanRenderPass(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                         const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                         const ast::VulkanSwapchain& swapchain);

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

Note that we need the *device* as it is the component that creates the render pass. We need the *physical device* to find out what the multi sampling level and depth formats are. We need the *swapchain* to find out the colour format to use when rendering to the colour attachment.

Now enter the following into `vulkan-render-pass.cpp` - note we will work through the `createRenderPass` function separately so we can spend time on its details:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-render-pass.hpp"

using ast::VulkanRenderPass;

namespace
{
    vk::UniqueRenderPass createRenderPass(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                          const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                          const ast::VulkanSwapchain& swapchain)
    {
    }
} // namespace

struct VulkanRenderPass::Internal
{
    const vk::UniqueRenderPass renderPass;

    Internal(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSwapchain& swapchain)
        : renderPass(::createRenderPass(physicalDevice, device, swapchain)) {}
};

VulkanRenderPass::VulkanRenderPass(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                   const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                   const ast::VulkanSwapchain& swapchain)
    : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>(physicalDevice, device, swapchain)) {}
```

**createRenderPass function**

We will walk slowly through the `createRenderPass` function and I'll try to explain the parts of it as we go.

First up, we query the swapchain for its *colour format* - we need to know this so our render pass can output its rendering result in a compatible format for consumption by the swapchain. If we used a different colour format to the swapchain's colour format they would be incompatible. We also query the physical device for its *multi sampling level* and *depth format* using the functions we added earlier in this article:

```cpp
namespace
{
    vk::UniqueRenderPass createRenderPass(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                          const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                          const ast::VulkanSwapchain& swapchain)
    {
        vk::Format colorFormat{swapchain.getColorFormat()};
        vk::SampleCountFlagBits multiSamplingLevel{physicalDevice.getMultiSamplingLevel()};
        vk::Format depthFormat{physicalDevice.getDepthFormat()};
```

**Colour attachment**

The first *attachment* is the *colour attachment*. Like all attachments, it is defined through a `vk::AttachmentDescription` object:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentDescription colorAttachment{
    vk::AttachmentDescriptionFlags(),          // Flags
    colorFormat,                               // Format
    multiSamplingLevel,                        // Samples
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eClear,              // Load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eStore,             // Store operation
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eDontCare,           // Stencil load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eDontCare,          // Stencil store operation
    vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined,               // Initial layout
    vk::ImageLayout::eColorAttachmentOptimal}; // Final layout
```

The configuration comprises of:

- Format: `colorFormat`: Apply the same colour format as the swapchain to its output.
- Samples: `multiSamplingLevel`: Apply the multi sampling level supported by the current physical device to the output.
- Load operation: `eClear`: The initial state for the colour attachment is to clear its content.
- Store operation: `eStore`: The result of this attachment should be *stored* otherwise it wouldn't persist as output.
- Stencil load/store operations: These are set to `eDontCare` because this attachment is a colour attachment and doesn't do any kind of depth testing operations.
- Initial layout: `eUndefined`: There will be no initial layout at the start of operations for this attachment. You can read more about image layouts here: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkImageLayout.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkImageLayout.html).
- Final layout: `eColorAttachmentOptimal`: Use specifically for *colour attachments*.

Remembering that each attachment description should be coupled with an attachment reference, we next write the attachment reference for our colour attachment:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentReference colorAttachmentReference{
    0,                                         // Attachment index
    vk::ImageLayout::eColorAttachmentOptimal}; // Layout
```

The *attachment index* of `0` will inform the consumer of the reference to look at position 0 in an array of attachments to find this one. The *layout* reflects that this is a colour attachment.

**Depth testing attachment**

Next up is our attachment to describe how to do depth testing within the render pass:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentDescription depthTestingAttachment{
    vk::AttachmentDescriptionFlags(),                 // Flags
    depthFormat,                                      // Format
    multiSamplingLevel,                               // Samples
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eClear,                     // Load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eDontCare,                 // Store operation
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eDontCare,                  // Stencil load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eDontCare,                 // Stencil store operation
    vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined,                      // Initial layout
    vk::ImageLayout::eDepthStencilAttachmentOptimal}; // Final layout
```

While similar to our colour attachment there are a few subtle differences:

- Format: `depthFormat`: This time the colour format to use is the `depthFormat` from our physical device.
- Samples: `multiSamplingLevel`: The depth testing attachment must have the same multi sampling level as the colour attachment.
- Load operation: `eClear`: Initially the attachment should clear itself before use.
- Store operation: `eDontCare`: We don't write the depth testing attachment to any kind of output image so we don't care.
- Stencil load/store operations: `eDontCare`: We aren't concerned about storing stencil operations.
- Initial layout: `eUndefined`: No initial layout.
- Final layout: `eDepthStencilAttachmentOptimal`: This declares that the attachment is for the purposes of depth testing.

And of course we need an accompanying attachment reference:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentReference depthTestingAttachmentReference{
    1,                                                // Attachment index
    vk::ImageLayout::eDepthStencilAttachmentOptimal}; // Layout
```

This time you might notice the *attachment index* is `1` whereas our colour attachment index was `0`. This specifies that the depth testing attachment description can be found at position 1 in the list of attachments (we will create the list of attachments soon).

**Multi sampling attachment**

Our multi sampling attachment actually goes into a property named *resolve attachment* because it is used to *resolve* the final image output for the subpass. The multi sampling would be applied when *resolving* the final image to suppress aliasing in the image:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentDescription multiSamplingAttachment{
    vk::AttachmentDescriptionFlags(), // Flags
    colorFormat,                      // Format
    vk::SampleCountFlagBits::e1,      // Samples
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eDontCare,  // Load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eStore,    // Store operation
    vk::AttachmentLoadOp::eDontCare,  // Stencil load operation
    vk::AttachmentStoreOp::eDontCare, // Stencil store operation
    vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined,      // Initial layout
    vk::ImageLayout::ePresentSrcKHR}; // Final layout
```

The properties are:

- Format: `colorFormat`: Again, this should be the same as the colour format for the swapchain because multi sampling still emits an output image just like the colour attachment does.
- Samples: `e1`: A bit odd since this attachment *is* the multi sampling attachment but effectively saying that the output of the multi sampling attachment isn't expected to be itself multi sampled again.
- Load operation: `eDontCare`: No special load conditions needed.
- Store operation: `eStore`: The output of this attachment should be stored, as it will become the final image forwarded to the renderer presentation queue.
- Stencil load/store: `eDontCare`: This attachment performs no depth testing related functions.
- Initial layout: `eUndefined`: Same as for the other attachments.
- Final layout: `ePresentSrcKHR`: This one is a bit interesting, the final image layout for the multi sampling attachment is in a layout that will become the *source* for *presentation* to the screen.

And for the attachment reference:

```cpp
vk::AttachmentReference multiSamplingAttachmentReference{
    2,                                         // Attachment index
    vk::ImageLayout::eColorAttachmentOptimal}; // Layout
```

Here we are specifying `2` as the index position where the attachment description can be found and the layout is `eColorAttachmentOptimal` because the output of the multi sampling is still effectively a colour image.

**List of all attachments**

We now create a list (technically a `std::array`) holding our three attachments so it can be passed into another configuration object soon. Observe that the order of the attachments reflects the `attachment index` values we specified in each of the attachment references. If the attachment indices don't correlate to the correct attachment descriptions in the array our render pass will not function properly:

```cpp
std::array<vk::AttachmentDescription, 3> attachments{
    colorAttachment,
    depthTestingAttachment,
    multiSamplingAttachment};
```

**Subpass**

We have created all the attachments we need, but a render pass needs at least one *subpass*. Our subpass will stitch together all the attachments to describe how to perform its operations:

```cpp
vk::SubpassDescription subpass{
    vk::SubpassDescriptionFlags(),     // Flags
    vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics,  // Pipeline bind point
    0,                                 // Input attachment count
    nullptr,                           // Input attachments
    1,                                 // Color attachments count
    &colorAttachmentReference,         // Color attachments
    &multiSamplingAttachmentReference, // Resolve attachments
    &depthTestingAttachmentReference,  // Depth stencil attachments
    0,                                 // Preserve attachments count
    nullptr};                          // Preserve attachments
```

The properties are:

- Pipeline bind point: `eGraphics`: This describes what stage of the rendering pipeline this subpass should execute. Other options are `compute` and `ray tracing` which is something supported by more contemporary video hardware (at the time of writing).
- Input attachments: `0` / `nullptr`: We don't use any *input* attachments. The subsequent property is `nullptr` due to this.
- Colour attachments count: `1`: We only have one colour attachment which we just wrote.
- Colour attachments: `&colorAttachmentReference`: Notice that we are adding the colour *attachment reference*, **not** the *attachment description*.
- Resolve attachments: `&multiSamplingAttachmentReference`: This is our multi sampling attachment which *resolves* the final output image.
- Depth stencil attachments: `&depthTestingAttachmentReference`: This is our depth testing attachment.
- Preserve attachments: `0` / `nullptr`: We don't use these.

**Subpass dependencies**

We have a subpass and even though we only have one of them, we must define its *dependencies*. If we had more than one subpass, the dependencies would allow Vulkan to orchestrate the order of operations amongst them:

```cpp
vk::SubpassDependency subpassDependency{
    0,                                                                                    // Source subpass index
    0,                                                                                    // Destination subpass index
    vk::PipelineStageFlagBits::eColorAttachmentOutput,                                    // Source access mask
    vk::PipelineStageFlagBits::eColorAttachmentOutput,                                    // Destination access mask
    vk::AccessFlags(),                                                                    // Source access flags
    vk::AccessFlagBits::eColorAttachmentRead | vk::AccessFlagBits::eColorAttachmentWrite, // Destination access flags
    vk::DependencyFlags()};                                                               // Dependency flags
```

The important properties:

- Source/destination subpass index: `0`: We only have one subpass so it can be found at the first position in the list of subpasses for the render pass instance.
- Source/destination access mask: `eColorAttachmentOutput`: This controls the point in time when the subpass should be considered. Go to [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPipelineStageFlagBits.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPipelineStageFlagBits.html) to learn about the different pipeline stage flags. In particular our dependency is defined as:

> "VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT specifies the stage of the pipeline after blending where the final color values are output from the pipeline. This stage also includes subpass load and store operations and multisample resolve operations for framebuffer attachments with a color or depth/stencil format."

- Source access flags: `vk::AccessFlags()`: Default flags nothing special needed.
- Destination access flags: `vk::AccessFlagBits::eColorAttachmentRead | vk::AccessFlagBits::eColorAttachmentWrite`: The destination flags require the ability to both read and write to the colour attachment during its operation.

**Render pass creation info**

We can now use all the components we've configured to describe the actual render pass itself through a `vk::RenderPassCreateInfo` object.

```cpp
vk::RenderPassCreateInfo renderPassCreateInfo{
    vk::RenderPassCreateFlags(),               // Flags
    static_cast<uint32_t>(attachments.size()), // Attachment count
    attachments.data(),                        // Attachments
    1,                                         // Subpass count
    &subpass,                                  // Subpasses
    1,                                         // Dependency count
    &subpassDependency};                       // Dependencies
```

- Attachment count: `static_cast<uint32_t>(attachments.size())`: Remember we created an array earlier which contains all of our attachment descriptions - this property specifies how many there were.
- Attachments: `attachments.data()`: This is the memory location of the array. Coupled with the *attachment count*, Vulkan will know how many attachment descriptions to read from the memory location.
- Subpass count: `1`: We only defined one subpass, so ...
- Subpasses: `&subpass`: The memory location to read in the subpass configurations.
- Dependency count: `1`: Yep, we only made one of those too ...
- Dependencies: `&subpassDependency`: The memory location to read in the subpass dependencies.

**Create render pass**

Ok, finally we can create and return the render pass, by invoking the correct method on our *device*:

```cpp
return device.getDevice().createRenderPassUnique(renderPassCreateInfo);
```

<hr/>

## Update render context

We have enough of our render pass written now to instantiate one in our Vulkan render context. Pop open `vulkan-render-context.cpp` and add the render pass header:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-render-pass.hpp"
```

Then go to the `Internal` struct and add a field to hold a render pass and create it in the constructor:

```cpp
struct VulkanRenderContext::Internal
{
    const ast::VulkanSwapchain swapchain;
    const ast::VulkanRenderPass renderPass;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : swapchain(ast::VulkanSwapchain(window, physicalDevice, device, surface)),
          renderPass(ast::VulkanRenderPass(physicalDevice, device, swapchain)) {}
};
```

Run your application and once again you won't see anything different but if it boots up with Vulkan successfully initialised you know that our render pass was created correctly.

Phew ... you might want to stop here for a minute and absorb all that - maybe have a coffee or a sleep. There is still a fair bit more to go but we are chipping away at it!!

<hr/>

## Where are we?

It is worth a quick note that the code we are writing at the moment is still executed during the *constructor* of the Vulkan application class. This means that any exceptions that propagate out will cause our main engine to fall back to the OpenGL implementation. We have a few more things to initialise during construction but eventually we will reach a point where we stop running the code during construction and instead defer it through our *scene* class during the application loop.

<hr/>

## Summary

I have broken the renderer implementation into multiple articles to avoid them getting too long. In the next article we will revisit our *render pass* class and add *frame buffers* to it which are required to fulfill the *render pass -> swapchain image* relationship.
