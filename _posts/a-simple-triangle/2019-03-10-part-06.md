In this article we are going to add in the Emscripten platform target to our existing workspace. This will give us a way to run our application within a WebGL compatible browser.

For me this is one of the coolest technologies I got to play with while writing this series of articles. Many (many!) years ago I was a professional multimedia developer and spent a great deal of my time developing rich browser applications using Adobe Flash and have also published mobile applications developed with Adobe AIR. 

Around the same time that Steve Jobs killed off Flash (yeah he did) I shifted gears and gave up being a multimedia developer and instead became a mobile app developer with more of a focus on business centric mobile apps. To see a modern technology like Emscripten that allows rich multimedia software to run in the browser again really impresses me and reminds me of my multimedia days.

Enough reminiscing though, let's get into it. I would **highly recommend** spending a good amount of time reading the official Emscripten site: [https://emscripten.org](https://emscripten.org) - the technology is truly remarkable and is a great use case of [LLVM](http://llvm.org).

The technical approach I settled on to successfully run an Emscripten project is similar to the other platform targets we've implemented but with greater reliance on the Emscripten tools themselves. In fact, you have to compile your Emscripten project using a custom C++ compiler provided by the Emscripten SDK. We also need to splice a bit of `#ifdef` type code to apply Emscripten specific code paths in our C++, but its not too bad.

The good news is that we can model our application build with a `CMakeLists.txt` file, very much like we did for the console and Android projects - so there will be some familiarity for those of you who have persevered this far with my series of articles.

To recap where we got to in our previous article we:

- Setup the Android platform target using a mix of Android Studio, CMake and shell scripts.
- Added the Android platform and conditional code into the shared C++ source to accommodate our Android target.

In this article, we will onboard our Emscripten platform target which will consist of:

- A CMake based project, editable in Visual Studio Code and compiled with the Emscripten SDK tools.
- A HTML template file that will run our Emscripten application in a browser.

<hr/>

## Setup the Emscripten SDK

There is no IDE or specific development environment for creating Emscripten applications so we will keep using Visual Studio Code as we've done before.

In order to compile our code we will need to fetch and configure the Emscripten SDK as well as ensuring that we have CMake available. As we've done many times before, we'll automate the setup and configuration through a `setup.sh` script.

To get started, create a new folder named `emscripten` as a sibling to our other platform targets:

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
```

Create a new text file named `setup.sh` in the `emscripten` folder, and mark it as executable as normal (`chmod +x setup.sh`):

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
      setup.sh
```

Enter the following script into `setup.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Include the shared scripts and utility methods that are common to all platforms.
. ../shared-scripts.sh

fetch_brew_dependency "wget"
fetch_brew_dependency "cmake"

fetch_third_party_lib_sdl

# If required, download and configure the Emscripten SDK into the third-party folder.
pushd ../../third-party
    if [ ! -d "emscripten" ]; then
        echo "Fetching Emscripten SDK ..."

        # Download the Emscripten SDK as a zip file from GitHub.
        wget https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/archive/master.zip

        # Unzip the Emscripten SDK.
        unzip -q master.zip

        # Rename it to 'emscripten'.
        mv emsdk-master emscripten

        # Clean up the zip file we downloaded.
        rm master.zip

        pushd emscripten
            echo "Updating Emscripten SDK ..."
            ./emsdk update

            echo "Installing latest Emscripten SDK ..."
            ./emsdk install latest

            echo "Activating latest Emscripten SDK ..."
            ./emsdk activate latest
        popd
    fi
popd
```

Points of interest:

- We are including our `shared-scripts.sh` as we normally do.
- We need to have `wget` and `cmake` installed, similar to some of our other platforms.
- We need the SDL source code library - however this will **only** be needed as a reference to the header files. Emscripten has its own ports of the SDL2 libraries that it will automatically fetch during compilation. This is fairly different to how we've had to link to frameworks or static libraries for the other platform targets.
- We need to download the actual Emscripten SDK itself, then `update`, `install` and `activate` it.

Run the setup script and you should see output similar to this (I've trimmed it for brevity):

> Note: Be patient, the Emscripten SDK is fairly large and the `update`, `install` and `activate` steps can take some time.

```

Note that in the `third-party` folder there is now a new `emscripten` folder. This is where the Emscripten SDK has been installed.

<hr/>

## Define a CMakeLists.txt

Our `CMakeLists.txt` file is the heart of our Emscripten project as it defines what to compile and how to influence the Emscripten compiler.

Create a new text file named `CMakeLists.txt` in the `root/project/emscripten` folder:

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
      CMakeLists.txt
      setup.sh
```

Edit `CMakeLists.txt` and enter the following text:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)

# We are using C++ 17 and will make use of C++ exceptions.
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++17 -fexceptions")

set(THIRD_PARTY_DIR "../../third-party")
set(MAIN_SOURCE_DIR "../main/src")
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/out)

include_directories(${THIRD_PARTY_DIR}/SDL/include)

file(GLOB_RECURSE CPP_HEADERS ${MAIN_SOURCE_DIR}/*.hpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE CPP_SOURCES ${MAIN_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cpp)

# The 'a-simple-triangle' executable is the output target for our Emscripten application and is why we end up with 'a-simple-triangle.js' in the output folder. Note that it will use the C++ source code from the shared 'main' folder through the collated sources.
add_executable(
    a-simple-triangle
    ${CPP_HEADERS}
    ${CPP_SOURCES}
)

# These properties specify what kind of Emscripten build to perform and are assigned to our 'a-simple-triangle' executable target.
set_target_properties(
    a-simple-triangle
    PROPERTIES
    LINK_FLAGS
    "-O2 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_WEBGL2=1"
)
```

Most of this file is the same as for our console target, in fact the only difference is the last section where we are calling `set_target_properties`. The target properties for the `a-simple-triangle` `LINK_FLAGS` are:

- `-02`: This is a compiler optimization flag that is [best described here](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html#emcc-compiler-optimization-options).
- `-s USE_SDL=2`: This flag indicates that Emscripten should download its own port of SDL2 and link against it. Note that Emscripten also ships with SDL1 support but we do **not** want to use that. Emscripten will do some magic at compile time to figure out if it needs to fetch the SDL2 port or not. When it is done you can actually find the downloaded files in the `~/.emscripten_ports` folder, but you don't need to worry about them too much.
- `-s USE_WEBGL=1`: This will enable some WebGL optimizations that may help our application performance. [Here is the doco if you want to learn more](https://emscripten.org/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-WebGL.html#which-gl-mode-to-target).

One thing that we don't define in the `CMakeLists.txt` file is **which** compiler to use to build the code. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to define the compiler *inside* the `CMakeLists.txt` file - I could only figure out how to specify it from the script that performs the build.

<hr/>

## Build script

The shiny new `CMakeLists.txt` file isn't going to do much without a script to invoke CMake to build it. Let's create a new build script for our Emscripten target. Create a new text file named `build.sh` in the `root/project/emscripten` folder, make it executable (`chmod +x build.sh`) and enter the following text:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Include the shared scripts and utility methods that are common to all platforms.
. ../shared-scripts.sh

# Make sure we have a 'build' folder.
if [ ! -d "build" ]; then
    mkdir build
fi

# Remove the 'out' folder if it exists.
if [ -d "out" ]; then
    rm -rf out
fi

# In order to find the Emscripten build tools, we need to configure some environment variables so they are available during the build. The required environment variables are initialized by sourcing the 'emsdk_env.sh' that ships with the Emscripten SDK.
pushd ../../third-party/emscripten
    echo "Configuring Emscripten environment variables"
    . ./emsdk_env.sh
popd

# Hop into the 'build' folder to start our CMake build.
pushd build
	
    # Because we sourced the Emscripten environment variables, we can use the 'EMSCRIPTEN' var to know where the current SDK can be found, which we need so we can locate the 'Emscripten.cmake' toolchain file.
    EMSCRIPTEN_CMAKE_PATH=${EMSCRIPTEN}/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake

    # We ask CMake to configure itself against the parent folder, but unlike our other platform targets, we will tell CMake to use the Emscripten CMake toolchain which knows how to perform Emscripten builds.
    echo "Emscripten CMake path: ${EMSCRIPTEN_CMAKE_PATH}"
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${EMSCRIPTEN_CMAKE_PATH} ..

    # Start the actual build.
    echo "Building project ..."
    make
popd
```

Points of interest:

- Our script will make sure we have a `build` folder and if there is an existing `out` folder, it will be deleted to ensure clean build output.
- Before performing any Emscripten command line builds, we need to know where all the Emscripten tools are located. The Emscripten SDK comes with a script named `emsdk_env.sh` which injects Emscripten environment variables into the current Terminal session. You can see that our build script loads the `emsdk_env.sh` before initiating a build, ensuring that the environment is correctly configured.
- The Emscripten SDK has a file named `Emscripten.cmake`, which we need to supply to the `cmake` command as the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` property. This file configures the build to use the Emscripten compiler and tools, instead of the default tools that CMake would otherwise use.

Close the `build.sh` file and run it from the command line, you will see output similar to this:

```
$ ./build.sh

## Fixing the compilation errors

If you recall the compiler warnings and errors from the Android setup article you might see a familiar theme here. Let's refresh the reasons for the warnings and errors.

**Non void function control warning**

```
<snip>/root/project/main/src/core/platform.cpp:15:1: warning: 
      control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
}
^
```

This warning is happening because our C++ code which figures out what platform we are on does not yet accommodate the Emscripten target. Here is the existing code:

```cpp
#pragma once

namespace ast
{
    enum class Platform
    {
        mac,
        ios,
        android
    };

    Platform getCurrentPlatform();
} // namespace ast
```

and

```cpp
#include "platform.hpp"

ast::Platform ast::getCurrentPlatform()
{
#if defined(__APPLE__)
#include "TargetConditionals.h"
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
    return ast::Platform::ios;
#else
    return ast::Platform::mac;
#endif
#elif __ANDROID__
    return ast::Platform::android;
#endif
}
```

Note that there is no enumeration for `ast::Platform::emscripten` and no conditional logic to accommodate it. Let's correct it now, edit the `main/src/core/platform.hpp` file to look like:

```cpp
#pragma once

namespace ast
{
    enum class Platform
    {
        mac,
        ios,
        android,
        emscripten
    };

    Platform getCurrentPlatform();
} // namespace ast
```

Note the addition of the `emscripten` enum.

Edit the `main/src/core/platform.cpp` file to look like:

```cpp
#include "platform.hpp"

ast::Platform ast::getCurrentPlatform()
{
#if defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)
    return ast::Platform::emscripten;
#elif __APPLE__
#include "TargetConditionals.h"
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
    return ast::Platform::ios;
#else
    return ast::Platform::mac;
#endif
#elif __ANDROID__
    return ast::Platform::android;
#endif
}
```

Note the addition of the `__EMSCRIPTEN__` conditional check. I've placed the Emscription conditional check first, so it is evaluated at the earliest point in time. You can see that if we are building for Emscripten, we return the `emscripten` enum now. This should resolve the warning about not returning a value from a non-void function.

Next we need to deal with these kind of errors:

```
<snip>/root/part-06-setup-emscripten/main/src/main.cpp:9:5: error: 
      use of undeclared identifier 'glClearColor'
    glClearColor(0.3f, 0.7f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    ^
```

Just like for the Android project, the reason for these errors is that we don't accommodate the Emscripten platform in the preprocessor conditional code in the `graphics-wrapper.hpp` file.

Change the `main/src/core/graphics-wrapper.hpp` from this:

```cpp
#pragma once

#if defined(__APPLE__)
#define GL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION
#include "TargetConditionals.h"
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
#include <OpenGLES/ES2/gl.h>
#else
#include <OpenGL/gl3.h>
#endif
#elif __ANDROID__
#include <GLES2/gl2.h>
#endif
```

to this:

```cpp
#pragma once

#if defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)
#include <GLES2/gl2.h>
#elif __APPLE__
#define GL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION
#include "TargetConditionals.h"
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
#include <OpenGLES/ES2/gl.h>
#else
#include <OpenGL/gl3.h>
#endif
#elif __ANDROID__
#include <GLES2/gl2.h>
#endif
```

Note the addition of the `__EMSCRIPTEN__` conditional check. I'm also checking for Emscripten first. The include is actually the same as for Android but we'll keep them written separately for clarity. This should now resolve all of our OpenGL errors.

Run the `build.sh` script again, and our Emscripten application should successfully compile.

> Note: The first time you compile your application, Emscripten will likely need to build and cache some of its own internal dependencies. Subsequent builds don't do this and will be much faster, so just be patient the first time through.

I've trimmed the output to make it more compact, but it should look roughly like this:

```
$ ./build.sh

```

If you re-run the build script again, you will see that all the `generating system library` commands do not execute again:

```
$ ./build.sh
Configuring Emscripten environment variables
Building project ...
Scanning dependencies of target a-simple-triangle
[ 25%] Building CXX object <snip>/main/src/main.cpp.o
[ 50%] Linking CXX executable ../out/a-simple-triangle.js
[100%] Built target a-simple-triangle
```

<hr/>

## Where is the output?

The build message `Linking CXX executable ../out/a-simple-triangle.js` should give us a clue as to what is actually generated during an Emscripten build.

If you observe the `root/project/emscripten` folder you will see that it has a new folder named `out` which contains the generated result of our build. It will look something like:

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
      + out
        a-simple-triangle.js
        a-simple-triangle.wasm
```

The `a-simple-triangle.js` is just a generated Javascript file that is intended to be embedded in a HTML document, which bootstraps our application.

The `a-simple-triangle.wasm` is an interesting file - it represents our compiled C++ code but in the [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org) format. This file is the secret sauce that will be run by the browser to execute our Emscripten application.

**How do we actually run this code?**

A Javascript based application needs to be bootstrapped and hosted within a Javascript virtual machine in order to execute, which most web browsers offer - though it is totally possible to run Javascript without a web browser as long as you have a compatible virtual machine to run it in. Our Emscripten platform target is actually a Javascript application, so to run it in a browser we need to create a HTML document to load and start it.

> Note: If you would like to see how it is possible to run Javascript in a headless Javascript virtual machine, see my [Mockifer framework](https://github.com/MarcelBraghetto/mockifer) which uses the awesome [Duktape](https://www.duktape.org) library.

The Emscripten SDK has compilation arguments that will actually generate a HTML document for us during a build, but we are going to make our own `template` document so it can be customized the way we want it.

Create a new text file named `template.html` in the `emscripten` folder:

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
      template.html
```

Edit the `template.html` in Visual Studio Code (or whatever) and enter the following:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
        <style>
            canvas.emscripten {
                display:block;
                border: 0px none;
                background-color: #333333;
            }

            textarea.emscripten {
                resize: none;
                width: 600px;
                height: 200px;
                display:block;
                border: 0px none;
                padding: 8px;
                background-color: #222222;
                color: #ffffff;
                margin: 0px;
            }

            .content {
                border: 1px solid #333333;
                display: inline-block;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div class="content">
            <canvas class="emscripten" id="canvas" width="600", height="360" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()" tabindex=-1></canvas>
            <textarea class="emscripten" id="output" rows="8"></textarea>
        </div>

        <script type='text/javascript'>
            var Module = {
                preRun: [],
                postRun: [],
                print: (function () {
                    var element = document.getElementById('output');
                    if (element) element.value = '';
                    return function (text) {
                        if (arguments.length > 1) {
                            text = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(' ');
                        }

                        console.log(text);

                        if (element) {
                            element.value += text + "\n";
                            element.scrollTop = element.scrollHeight;
                        }
                    };
                })(),
                printErr: function (text) {
                    if (arguments.length > 1) {
                        text = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(' ');
                    }

                    console.error(text);
                },
                canvas: (function () {
                    return document.getElementById('canvas');
                })()
            };
        </script>
        <script async type="text/javascript" src="a-simple-triangle.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

A reasonable amount of the HTML was derived from the auto generated file that Emscripten produces. There are few important bits worth calling out:

```html
<canvas class="emscripten" id="canvas" width="600", height="360" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()" tabindex=-1></canvas>
```

This block registers a HTML `canvas` object with a fixed size of 600 x 360. Of course you can make it as large as you like. The `a-simple-triangle.js` file will ask for this canvas via the following function:

```javascript
canvas: (function () {
    return document.getElementById('canvas');

> Important: If you move the `width` and `height` properties for the `canvas` element into a CSS style, then querying the `canvas` for its width and height will return **the wrong values**. A word of advice is to leave the `width` and `height` as properties only. If you know some kind of CSS/Javascript trick to avoid this then feel free to ignore my advice but this problem stumped me for **far** too long when I hit it so you have been warned!



This block declares a text area where all our `cout` logging statements will appear:

```html
<textarea class="emscripten" id="output" rows="8"></textarea>
```

The rest of the document is just styling and wiring in some of the other Javascript - Emscripten functions.

## Automating the HTML template into the build

In order to use our new HTML template to load our Emscripten application, we will add a `post build` shell script along with a post build step in our `CMakeLists.txt` file to copy the HTML template file into our `out` folder whenever a build happens.

Create a new text file named `cmake-post-build.sh` in the `emscripten` folder and mark it as executable (`chmod +x cmake-post-build.sh`). Enter the following text into it:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Copy our 'template.html' into the output folder as 'index.html'.
cp template.html out/index.html

# Navigate into the output folder then start a simple server and open it.
pushd out
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 & open http://localhost:8000
popd
```

Next we need to update our `CMakeLists.txt` file to add in the post build step. Add the following to the end of the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `emscripten` folder:

```cmake
# When the build is complete we will run the 'cmake-post-build.sh' script.
add_custom_command(
    TARGET a-simple-triangle
    POST_BUILD
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
    COMMAND ./cmake-post-build.sh
)
```

We did the same thing in our first platform target (console) to run a shell script after the CMake build completes. In this case, CMake will run our `cmake-post-build.sh` script after it has compiled our code, which will in turn copy our HTML template file into the output folder, then open it in a browser via a simple Python web server that we start up in the `out` folder. To stop the server just `CTRL+C` in the Terminal session that is running it.

> Note: If you don't have Python you can install it with `brew install python`.

Save your changes, and re-run the build script again. The code should compile and open in a browser window.

> Important: The reason we are using a simple Python web server is related to the note about XHR request restrictions while viewing content locally at: [https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html). Depending on your browser, you may not need to host the output files in a local web server to view them, however we will do this. Also, some of the screenshots I took for this article was of the Emscripten application running in Firefox without a web server but via the Python web server the web address in the browser will be `http://localhost:8000`.

The `out` folder will look something like this:

```
root
  + project
    + emscripten
      + out
        a-simple-triangle.js
        a-simple-triangle.wasm
        index.html
```

Although the browser will open and run our application, you will see a blank view and will probably be warned that the page is slowing down your computer:

## Fixing the Emscripten main loop

The reason that our application doesn't look correct and is running slowly in the browser is related to the way an Emscripten application must define its `main loop` - that is, the block of code that runs repeatedly until the application quits.

Currently, our main loop is driven by this code in the `main.cpp` file:

```cpp
void runApplication()
{
    ...

    while (runMainLoop(window, context))
    {
        // Just waiting for the main loop to end.
    }
}
```

So basically, we are just in an endless `while` loop until the `runMainLoop` function returns a value of `false`. When this code executes within a browser, it effectively never relinquishes control to the browser during the loop causing our browser window to freeze while it waits for our program to complete.

The main looping requirement of an Emscripten application is best explained in this page [https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html), specifically in the `Browser main loop` section.

Not to worry though, with a few C++ code adjustments we can respect these requirements and have our Emscripten application running cooperatively within the browser.

Edit the `main.cpp` file and add the following at the top:

```cpp
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
#include <emscripten.h>
#endif
```

To use Emscripten SDK code we need to include the `<emscripten.h>` header, but we *only* want to do this if Emscripten is the platform we are building.

We will need to create a new function that meets the requirements of the `emscripten_set_main_loop` signature, of which we will be using the one shaped like `void (*)()`. This means that our existing `runMainLoop` function cannot be used, because it returns a `bool` and takes in argument parameters, and therefore has a different signature to what Emscripten will accept.

Create a new function **below** the `runMainLoop` function like so:

```cpp
#ifdef EMSCRIPTEN
void runEmscriptenMainLoop()
{
    runMainLoop();
}
#endif
```

Next we will need to update the `runApplication` function to start the main loop either using an Emscripten approach, or our existing approach:

```cpp
void runApplication()
{
    ...

#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
    emscripten_set_main_loop(runEmscriptenMainLoop, 60, 1);
#else
    while (runMainLoop())
    {
        // Just waiting for the main loop to end.
    }
#endif

    ...
}
```

A subtle difference is that we won't be passing the arguments `SDL_Window* window, const SDL_GLContext& context` any more because the Emscripten main loop won't be in the same scope as our `runApplication` function. There is actually a way to pass a strongly typed object into the Emscripten main loop method that we will use when we revisit this code in a future article, but for now we will simply declare the `SDL_Window* window` and `SDL_GLContext context` as member fields of `main.cpp`. While this approach is sufficient for now, it has a bit of a code smell about it so in a future article we will refactor the `main.cpp` class into something a bit more formal.

After the `#include` statements, create two fields:

```cpp
SDL_Window* window;
SDL_GLContext context;
```

Remove the arguments from the `render` function:

```cpp
void render(SDL_Window* window, const SDL_GLContext& context)
```

becomes

```cpp
void render()
```

> Note: you will also need to remove the arguments when calling the `render` function in the `runMainLoop` function.

Remove the arguments from the `runMainLoop` function:

```cpp
bool runMainLoop(SDL_Window* window, const SDL_GLContext& context)
```

becomes

```cpp
bool runMainLoop()
```

In the `runApplication` function change:

```cpp
// Create a new SDL window based on OpenGL.
SDL_Window* window{ast::sdl::createWindow(SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)};

// Obtain an OpenGL context based on our window.
SDL_GLContext context{SDL_GL_CreateContext(window)};
```

becomes

```cpp
// Create a new SDL window based on OpenGL.
window = ast::sdl::createWindow(SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI);

// Obtain an OpenGL context based on our window.
context = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);
```

After making all those changes, re-run the build script again and your browser should show the familiar green view:

<img src="/images/ast/part-06/browser-02.png" />

## Fixing the display size

Fantastic - our C++ code is actively running in the browser and OpenGL is working. That's pretty awesome I think. There is a problem though - notice the output that claims:

```
Display size is: 640 x 480
```

But we know that in our HTML template, we set the canvas size to be 600 x 360 because of this tag:

```html
<canvas class="emscripten" id="canvas" width="600", height="360" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()" tabindex=-1></canvas>
```

So, why on earth are we seeing 640 x 480 ?? Remember that in our `sdl-wrapper.cpp`, in the `ast::sdl::getDisplaySize` function, we decide whether to use a fixed size window, or fetch the dimensions of the display we are running on. At the moment, if the platform is not `ios` or `android`, we are using a fixed size of ... you guessed it: 640 x 480.

We will update the `ast::sdl::getDisplaySize` function so if we are running an Emscripten application we will query the actual HTML canvas object to find out how big it is. Edit the `sdl-wrapper.cpp` file and at the very top, enter our conditional include for Emscripten:

```cpp
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
#include <emscripten.h>
#endif
```

Now, replace the `getDisplaySize` function with:

```cpp
std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t> ast::sdl::getDisplaySize()
{
    uint32_t displayWidth{0};
    uint32_t displayHeight{0};

#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
    // For Emscripten targets we will invoke some Javascript
    // to find out the dimensions of the canvas in the HTML
    // document. Note that the 'width' and 'height' attributes
    // need to be set on the <canvas /> HTML element, like so:
    // <canvas id="canvas" width="600", height="360"></canvas>
    displayWidth = static_cast<uint32_t>(EM_ASM_INT({
        return document.getElementById('canvas').width;
    }));

    displayHeight = static_cast<uint32_t>(EM_ASM_INT({
        return document.getElementById('canvas').height;
    }));
#else
    switch (ast::getCurrentPlatform())
    {
        case ast::Platform::ios:
        case ast::Platform::android:
        {
            // For mobile platforms we will fetch the full screen size.
            SDL_DisplayMode displayMode;
            SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode(0, &displayMode);
            displayWidth = static_cast<uint32_t>(displayMode.w);
            displayHeight = static_cast<uint32_t>(displayMode.h);
            break;
        }

        default:
        {
            // For other platforms we'll just show a fixed size window.
            displayWidth = 640;
            displayHeight = 480;
            break;
        }
    }
#endif

    return std::make_pair(displayWidth, displayHeight);
}
```

Most of the code in that function is the same as before, except now we will conditionally fetch the width and height of the HTML canvas if the target is `__EMSCRIPTEN__`.

The interesting code is explained in the comments, but essentially an Emscripten application can invoke Javascript on its host browser. There are a few ways to do this, but the approach used here is to invoke the `EM_ASM_INT` function, which will evaluate the body of the function call as Javascript in the host browser and return an `int` as a result, which we then cast to `uint32_t`.

The lines of code that look like this are exactly what you would type as Javascript in the HTML page, and in this case would query the `canvas` DOM element, returning its `width` property:

```javascript
return document.getElementById('canvas').width;
```

<hr/>

## Final result

Save your C++ changes, then run the build script again to regenerate the Emscripten application and launch the browser. You should now see our beautiful green window at the correct size, like so:

<img src="/images/ast/part-06/browser-03.png" />

## Git ignore

If you were to commit *A Simple Triangle* into version control, you would want to create a new `.gitignore` file for the `root/platform/emscripten` folder, so it won't include all the files that get auto generated by running the Emscripten build. Here is a sample `.gitignore` that would achieve this for our project:

```
build
out
```

[The code for this article can be found here.](https://github.com/MarcelBraghetto/a-simple-triangle/tree/master/part-06-setup-emscripten)

In the next article we will work through the setup for the Windows platform.
