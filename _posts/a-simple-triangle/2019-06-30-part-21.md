In the previous article I mentioned that the *swapchain* is a Vulkan component which allows us to render to the screen and have off screen frame buffers that are cycled through, so the renderer can always be preparing the next frame while another is being presented. Creating an instance of a swapchain is a pretty dense coding exercise but we have little choice but to work our way through it as it is a prerequisite to rendering anything in Vulkan.

These sites provide some detailed explanations of the swapchain and ways to acquire one:

- [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkSwapchainKHR](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkSwapchainKHR)
- [https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/api-without-secrets-introduction-to-vulkan-part-2](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/api-without-secrets-introduction-to-vulkan-part-2)
- [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Presentation/Swap_chain](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Presentation/Swap_chain)

In the article about creating a *physical device* we wrote code to check for the support for the *swapchain* extension. We also requested the `VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME` extension when creating the *logical device* - so our application should be well positioned to successfully create a swapchain by the time we need one. That said, if we cannot create a swapchain it will trigger our fallback flow for our application - reverting to the OpenGL implementation.

<!-- excerpt -->

Our swapchain will need to have the following properties - some of which will require us to write a few new Vulkan components:

- What the colour format should be for the swapchain images.
- What the dimensions of the swapchain should be - typically this would match our screen dimensions.
- How an image that the swapchain should present should be *transformed* - such as rotating it to align with the host device display.
- What *presentation* mode to use - this configures the way in which the screen is *refreshed* given the available hardware.

## Create the VulkanSwapchain class

Our swapchain will be encapsulated in its own wrapper class - get started by creating `vulkan-swapchain.hpp` and `vulkan-swapchain.cpp` in the `application/vulkan` folder.

>Note: We will use the spelling `Swapchain` rather than `SwapChain` to align with the approach taken within the Vulkan SDK itself. The lower case `c` feels a little odd to me, but we will just pretend that `Swapchain` is a noun in its own right rather than two separate nouns - `Swap` `Chain` - just go with it!

Edit the header file with the following:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"
#include "../../core/sdl-window.hpp"
#include "vulkan-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-physical-device.hpp"
#include "vulkan-surface.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanSwapchain
    {
        VulkanSwapchain(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
                        const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                        const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                        const ast::VulkanSurface& surface);

        const vk::SwapchainKHR& getSwapchain() const;

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

Our *swapchain* will need to query properties of our *window*, *physical device* *device* and *surface* to gather all the information it needs. It will also expose a public `getSwapchain` function. The implementation will be fairly long so we'll break it down into chunks and build it up as we go.

<hr/>

## Acquire swapchain format

We will first work on how to find out what colour format and configuration to apply to our swapchain. The physical device and surface will determine what options are available for us to choose from. Enter the following into `vulkan-swapchain.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-swapchain.hpp"
#include "../../core/log.hpp"

using ast::VulkanSwapchain;

namespace
{
    struct VulkanSwapchainFormat
    {
        vk::ColorSpaceKHR colorSpace;
        vk::Format colorFormat;
    };

    VulkanSwapchainFormat getFormat(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                    const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
    {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanSwapchain::getFormat"};

        // We need to make sure that there is at least one surface format compatible with our surface.
        std::vector<vk::SurfaceFormatKHR> availableSurfaceFormats{
            physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfaceFormatsKHR(surface.getSurface())};

        size_t availableFormatCount{availableSurfaceFormats.size()};

        if (availableFormatCount == 0)
        {
            throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible surface formats found.");
        }

        // Take the first format as a 'default'.
        vk::SurfaceFormatKHR defaultFormat{availableSurfaceFormats[0]};

        // If there is only one surface with an undefined format, we will manually choose one.
        if (availableFormatCount == 1 && defaultFormat.format == vk::Format::eUndefined)
        {
            ast::log(logTag, "Surface format is undefined: defaulting to eSrgbNonlinear + eR8G8B8Unorm.");
            return VulkanSwapchainFormat{vk::ColorSpaceKHR::eSrgbNonlinear, vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm};
        }

        // We will look through the available formats, attempting to prefer the eR8G8B8Unorm type.
        for (const auto& availableFormat : availableSurfaceFormats)
        {
            if (availableFormat.format == vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm)
            {
                ast::log(logTag, "Found supported eR8G8B8Unorm surface format.");
                return VulkanSwapchainFormat{availableFormat.colorSpace, availableFormat.format};
            }
        }

        // Otherwise we will just have to use the first available format.
        ast::log(logTag, "Surface format eR8G8B8Unorm not found, using default available format.");
        return VulkanSwapchainFormat{defaultFormat.colorSpace, defaultFormat.format};
    }
} // namespace

struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    const VulkanSwapchainFormat format;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : format(::getFormat(physicalDevice, surface)) {}
};

VulkanSwapchain::VulkanSwapchain(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
                                 const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                 const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                 const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
    : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>(window, physicalDevice, device, surface)) {}
```

We are declaring a file private struct named `VulkanSwapchainFormat` to model the format for our swapchain, which will contain the colour space and surface format to use. This data could be held in a simple tuple but the struct gives it a bit more of a formal treatment:

```cpp
namespace
{
    struct VulkanSwapchainFormat
    {
        vk::ColorSpaceKHR colorSpace;
        vk::Format colorFormat;
    };
```

The `Internal` struct will create and hold a `VulkanSwapchainFormat` object, which it derives from the `getFormat` free function:

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    const VulkanSwapchainFormat format;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : format(::getFormat(physicalDevice, surface)) {}
};
```

The `getFormat` function begins by querying the *physical device* for all of the available *surface formats* it can provide which meet the criteria of our *surface* argument. If we have no available surface formats which meet this criteria then we have to bail early:

```cpp
VulkanSwapchainFormat getFormat(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
{
    static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanSwapchain::getFormat"};

    // We need to make sure that there is at least one surface format compatible with our surface.
    std::vector<vk::SurfaceFormatKHR> availableSurfaceFormats{
        physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfaceFormatsKHR(surface.getSurface())};

    size_t availableFormatCount{availableSurfaceFormats.size()};

    if (availableFormatCount == 0)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible surface formats found.");
    }
```

Next we grab the first surface format in the list of available formats as a *default*:

```cpp
vk::SurfaceFormatKHR defaultFormat{availableSurfaceFormats[0]};
```

On the condition that there is only *one* available surface format and it has a format type of `vk::Format::eUndefined` (which aliases the `VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED` typedef) then we will just choose the `vk::ColorSpaceKHR::eSrgbNonlinear` colour space and the `vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm` format type instead:

```cpp
if (availableFormatCount == 1 && defaultFormat.format == vk::Format::eUndefined)
{
    ast::log(logTag, "Surface format is undefined: defaulting to eSrgbNonlinear + eR8G8B8Unorm.");
    return VulkanSwapchainFormat{vk::ColorSpaceKHR::eSrgbNonlinear, vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm};
}
```

If we have multiple surface formats then we will iterate the available formats looking for the one we prefer (`vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm`) and if we find it, use it as the result:

```cpp
for (const auto& availableFormat : availableSurfaceFormats)
{
    if (availableFormat.format == vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm)
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "Found supported eR8G8B8Unorm surface format.");
        return VulkanSwapchainFormat{availableFormat.colorSpace, availableFormat.format};
    }
}
```

If we couldn't find `vk::Format::eR8G8B8Unorm` then we'll just go with whatever was in the *default* format:

```cpp
ast::log(logTag, "Surface format eR8G8B8Unorm not found, using default available format.");
return VulkanSwapchainFormat{defaultFormat.colorSpace, defaultFormat.format};
```

We can run this code now by revisiting `vulkan-context.cpp` and adding the following header:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-swapchain.hpp"
```

Then updating the `Internal` struct to add a swapchain member field and initialise it in the constructor:

```cpp
struct VulkanContext::Internal
{
    ...
    const ast::VulkanSwapchain swapchain;

    Internal() : ...
                 swapchain(ast::VulkanSwapchain(window, physicalDevice, device, surface))
```

Also add the public getter function to the bottom of the swapchain implementation to expose the swapchain instance:

```cpp
const vk::SwapchainKHR& VulkanSwapchain::getSwapchain() const
{
    return internal->swapchain.get();
}
```

Run the application and depending on your configuration you should see some logging output indicating which surface format the swapchain will use.

## Determine which presentation mode to use

The *presentation mode* is the way in which Vulkan will send the rendered images to the display device. There are a variety of presentation modes that *may* be available - varying in their quality and abilities. The different modes are explained in reasonable detail in the official docs here: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPresentModeKHR.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPresentModeKHR.html).

If you are a PC gamer you probably know about the term *vsync* which is a technique where the *vertical sync* rate also known as the *refresh rate* of your display monitor can be used to govern when a frame is rendered during game play. When a game is configured to respect the refresh rate of the monitor (*vysnc* is enabled), it will not render more frames per second than the monitor can support - for example if the monitor runs at 60hz refresh rate, with *vsync* enabled only up to 60 frames per second will be rendered.

The advantage of doing this is to avoid *tearing* which is caused by the graphics card drawing the next frame of a game at the same time the previous frame is still being presented through the monitor. This results in flickering and visual anomalies such as the screen *tearing* into two different views of the scene which is quite awful to experience in fast gameplay.

In our Vulkan application we will need to choose a *presentation mode* that gives us the best experience available. Generally we should prefer presentation modes that accommodate vertical sync behaviour to avoid the tearing problem. Of course nothing in Vulkan is straightforward and the collection of available presentation modes on a given device might not always let us use the option we would prefer. To choose a presentation mode we will evaluate what presentation modes are available based on the order we would like them - best to worst - and choose the first one that matches.

The presentation mode we will choose will be held as a `vk::PresentModeKHR` field in our swapchain class and when choosing it our preference of best to worst presentation modes is:

1. `vk::PresentModeKHR::eMailbox`
2. `vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifo`
3. `vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifoRelaxed`
4. `vk::PresentModeKHR::eImmediate`

The documentation claims that `eFifo` is the only presentation mode that is *required to be supported*, however we'll leave options 3 and 4 in anyway to be safe.

Add a new field to the swapchain internal struct and create it via the `getPresentationMode` free function (which we will write in a moment):

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    const VulkanSwapchainFormat format;
    const vk::PresentModeKHR presentationMode;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : format(::getFormat(physicalDevice, surface)),
          presentationMode(::getPresentationMode(physicalDevice, surface)) {}
};
```

Next we will author the `getPresentationMode` free function. Add the `#include <stack>` header, then author the `getPresentationMode` function in the anonymous namespace:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    vk::PresentModeKHR getPresentationMode(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                           const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanSwapchain::getPresentationMode"};

        // We need to make sure that there is at least one presentation mode compatible with our surface.
        std::vector<vk::PresentModeKHR> availableModes{
            physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfacePresentModesKHR(surface.getSurface())};

        if (availableModes.empty())
        {
            throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible present modes found.");
        }

        // Load up the presentation modes into a stack so they are popped
        // in our preferred order for evaluation.
        std::stack<vk::PresentModeKHR> preferredModes;
        preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eImmediate);
        preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifoRelaxed);
        preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifo);
        preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eMailbox);

        while (!preferredModes.empty())
        {
            // Take the mode at the top of the stack and see if the list of available modes contains it.
            vk::PresentModeKHR mode{preferredModes.top()};

            if (std::find(availableModes.begin(), availableModes.end(), mode) != availableModes.end())
            {
                // If we find the current preferred presentation mode, we are done.
                return mode;
            }

            // If our preferred mode is not found, pop the stack ready for the next iteration.
            preferredModes.pop();
        }

        // None of our preferred presentation modes were found, can't go further...
        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible presentation modes found.");
    }
}
```

We begin by querying our physical device for all the presentation modes it can support based on our surface criteria. If we have have no supported presentation modes then Vulkan ain't gonna work so we'll throw an exception ...

```cpp
vk::PresentModeKHR getPresentationMode(const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
                                       const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
{
    static const std::string logTag{"ast::VulkanSwapchain::getPresentationMode"};

    std::vector<vk::PresentModeKHR> availableModes{
        physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfacePresentModesKHR(surface.getSurface())};

    if (availableModes.empty())
    {
        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible present modes found.");
    }
```

With a list of available modes we then create a *stack* representing the presentation modes in the order we would prefer them. I've used a *stack* here so our order of preference is actually in reverse so we can *pop* them one at a time:

```cpp
std::stack<vk::PresentModeKHR> preferredModes;
preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eImmediate);
preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifoRelaxed);
preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifo);
preferredModes.push(vk::PresentModeKHR::eMailbox);
```

With a stack of preferred modes, we then iterate the stack while it isn't empty, popping each element then looking for it in the available list of modes. If we find a match we return it and we are done:

```cpp
while (!preferredModes.empty())
{
    vk::PresentModeKHR mode{preferredModes.top()};

    if (std::find(availableModes.begin(), availableModes.end(), mode) != availableModes.end())
    {
        return mode;
    }

    preferredModes.pop();
}
```

Of course, if none of the modes in our stack are available, we drop out:

```cpp
throw std::runtime_error(logTag + ": No compatible presentation modes found.");
```

That's it for choosing the presentation mode.

<hr/>

## Swapchain extent

Vulkan offers a simple struct to hold a *width* and *height* to represent a dimension in the form of `vk::Extent2D`. Our swapchain needs to know its *extent* to define how big it should be. We can query SDL to find out the size of the window we are drawing to, which can become our *width* and *height* values of the extent.

Add a new member field named `extent` and initialise it via the `getExtent` free function which we'll write in a sec:

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    const VulkanSwapchainFormat format;
    const vk::PresentModeKHR presentationMode;
    const vk::Extent2D extent;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : format(::getFormat(physicalDevice, surface)),
          presentationMode(::getPresentationMode(physicalDevice, surface)),
          extent(::getExtent(window)) {}
};
```

Add the `getExtent` free function:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    vk::Extent2D getExtent(const ast::SDLWindow& window)
    {
        int drawableWidth;
        int drawableHeight;
        SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize(window.getWindow(), &drawableWidth, &drawableHeight);

        return vk::Extent2D{
            static_cast<uint32_t>(drawableWidth),
            static_cast<uint32_t>(drawableHeight)};
    }
}
```

We are calling the `SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize` function and grabbing the resulting `drawableWidth` and `drawableHeight` values as a `vk::Extent2D` object.

<hr/>

## Surface transform flags

Our swapchain needs to know what *surface transform flags* are applicable for the current physical device and surface so it knows how to *transform* the output. Although we could query the physical device along with the surface to find out what transform is available, we will be using the *identity* transform, meaning the output image will not be rotated or changed:

```cpp
vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR::eIdentity
```

If we instead used the transform from the physical device it *might* be a bit faster, however on platforms such as Android our entire 3D scene would be rotated 90 degrees if our phone is in landscape which is no good. Although there are ways to counter this in code, for simplicity sake *identity* is the one we will use so it behaves the best across all our platforms.

Learn more about the transform flags here: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.html](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.html)

Add a new `vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR transform` field to hold the transform flags and initialise it with `vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR::eIdentity`:

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    const VulkanSwapchainFormat format;
    const vk::PresentModeKHR presentationMode;
    const vk::Extent2D extent;
    const vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR transform;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : format(::getFormat(physicalDevice, surface)),
          presentationMode(::getPresentationMode(physicalDevice, surface)),
          extent(::getExtent(window)),
          transform(vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR::eIdentity) {}
};
```

<hr/>

## Creating the swapchain

We now have all the components needed to create an instance of a `vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR` which we will hold in our swapchain class. Add a new field to hold the swapchain, initialised via the `createSwapchain()` function:

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    ...

    const vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR swapchain;

    Internal(const ast::SDLWindow& window,
             const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
             const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
             const ast::VulkanSurface& surface)
        : ...
          swapchain(::createSwapchain(physicalDevice, device, surface, format, presentationMode, extent, transform)),
```

Next we will write the `createSwapchain` function which does take quite a few arguments:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(
        const ast::VulkanPhysicalDevice& physicalDevice,
        const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
        const ast::VulkanSurface& surface,
        const VulkanSwapchainFormat& format,
        const vk::PresentModeKHR& presentationMode,
        const vk::Extent2D& extent,
        const vk::SurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR& transform)
    {
        // Grab the capabilities of the current physical device in relation to the surface.
        vk::SurfaceCapabilitiesKHR surfaceCapabilities{
            physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(surface.getSurface())};

        // We will pick a minimum image count of +1 to the minimum supported on the device.
        uint32_t minimumImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount + 1};
        uint32_t maxImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount};

        // Make sure our image count doesn't exceed any maximum if there is one.
        // Note: The Vulkan docs state that a value of 0 doesn't mean there is
        // a limit of 0, it means there there is no limit.
        if (maxImageCount > 0 && minimumImageCount > maxImageCount)
        {
            minimumImageCount = maxImageCount;
        }

        vk::SwapchainCreateInfoKHR createInfo{
            vk::SwapchainCreateFlagsKHR(),            // Flags
            surface.getSurface(),                     // Surface
            minimumImageCount,                        // Minimum image count
            format.colorFormat,                       // Image format
            format.colorSpace,                        // Image color space
            extent,                                   // Image extent
            1,                                        // Image array layers
            vk::ImageUsageFlagBits::eColorAttachment, // Image usage
            vk::SharingMode::eExclusive,              // Image sharing mode
            0,                                        // Queue family index count
            nullptr,                                  // Queue family indices
            transform,                                // Pre transform
            vk::CompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR::eOpaque,   // Composite alpha
            presentationMode,                         // Present mode
            VK_TRUE,                                  // Clipped
            vk::SwapchainKHR()};                      // Old swapchain

        // If our device has a discrete presentation queue, we must specify
        // that swapchain images are permitted to be shared between both
        // the graphics and presentation queues.
        if (device.hasDiscretePresentationQueue())
        {
            std::array<uint32_t, 2> queueIndices{
                device.getGraphicsQueueIndex(),
                device.getPresentationQueueIndex()};

            createInfo.imageSharingMode = vk::SharingMode::eConcurrent;
            createInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 2;
            createInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = queueIndices.data();
        }

        return device.getDevice().createSwapchainKHRUnique(createInfo);
    }
}
```

The swapchain will have a number of *images* which it rotates through as it cycles rendering frames. When configuring a swapchain we need to tell Vulkan the *minimum* number of images to use. Devices will support different minimum and maximum numbers of these images so we'll need to write some code to try and pick a number that is suitable. 

You can view the documentation about the *minimum* and *maximum* image count here: [https://khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.html](https://khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.html).

Vulkan can tell us the *minimum* and *maximum* number of images publicly supported for a given physical device through the `getSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR` function, which we can then query for the `minImageCount` and `maxImageCount` properties:

```cpp
vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(...)
{
    // Grab the capabilities of the current physical device in relation to the surface.
    vk::SurfaceCapabilitiesKHR surfaceCapabilities{
        physicalDevice.getPhysicalDevice().getSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(surface.getSurface())};

    // We will pick a minimum image count of +1 to the minimum supported on the device.
    uint32_t minimumImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount + 1};
    uint32_t maxImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount};
```

> Very important: The *maxImageCount* property does not mean the swapchain will not have more than that number of swapchain images once the swapchain has been created - it just advertises to us that it is the maximum number we can *request*. In fact on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, the *maxImageCount* reported by the surface capabilities was `3` however Vulkan actually generated `4` swapchain images internally when creating the swapchain. The take away from this is to never assume that the image count we come up with in the `createSwapchain` function represents the actual number of swapchain images Vulkan creates in the swapchain.

We will try to set the *minimum* number of images to `minImageCount` plus 1, but not exceeding `maxImageCount`.

```cpp
vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(...)
{
    ...

    // We will pick a minimum image count of +1 to the minimum supported on the device.
    uint32_t minimumImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount + 1};
    uint32_t maxImageCount{surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount};
```

The `maxImageCount` property can have a value of `0` which does **not** mean there is a limit of `0` - it means there is **no** maximum limit. So when evaluating our image count we must check if it exceeds the maximum image count **only** if the maximum image count is greater than `0`.

```cpp
vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(...)
{
    ...

    if (maxImageCount > 0 && minimumImageCount > maxImageCount)
    {
        minimumImageCount = maxImageCount;
    }
```

Once we have computed the minimum image count we would like we build a `vk::SwapchainCreateInfoKHR` object to describe how to create our swapchain:

```cpp
vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(...)
{
    ...

    vk::SwapchainCreateInfoKHR createInfo{
        vk::SwapchainCreateFlagsKHR(),            // Flags
        surface.getSurface(),                     // Surface
        minimumImageCount,                        // Minimum image count
        format.colorFormat,                       // Image format
        format.colorSpace,                        // Image color space
        extent,                                   // Image extent
        1,                                        // Image array layers
        vk::ImageUsageFlagBits::eColorAttachment, // Image usage
        vk::SharingMode::eExclusive,              // Image sharing mode
        0,                                        // Queue family index count
        nullptr,                                  // Queue family indices
        transform,                                // Pre transform
        vk::CompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR::eOpaque,   // Composite alpha
        presentationMode,                         // Present mode
        VK_TRUE,                                  // Clipped
        vk::SwapchainKHR()};                      // Old swapchain
```

We have to also perform a check to see if our logical device had identified that there is a *discrete presentation queue* - that is, different from the *graphics queue*. If it does have a discrete presentation queue, we need to adjust how we create the swapchain to allow it to share ownership of its images between both *graphics* and *presentation* queues and use the `eConcurrent` sharing mode. We also have to specify an array of the queue indices that represents who may share ownership - which are our graphics and presentation queues:

```cpp
vk::UniqueSwapchainKHR createSwapchain(...)
{
    ...

    if (device.hasDiscretePresentationQueue())
    {
        std::array<uint32_t, 2> queueIndices{
            device.getGraphicsQueueIndex(),
            device.getPresentationQueueIndex()};

        createInfo.imageSharingMode = vk::SharingMode::eConcurrent;
        createInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 2;
        createInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = queueIndices.data();
    }
```

Finally we ask our logical device to create a swapchain for us, using the `createInfo` object to configure it:

```cpp
return device.getDevice().createSwapchainKHRUnique(createInfo);
```

Run your application again to ensure that everything is firing OK - you can't see it but you will have successfully created the swapchain which is a big step forward for our Vulkan implementation.

## Swapchain images

We have one final task when creating our swapchain - we must also create a collection of *image views* to access each of the swapchain images. We have already told the swapchain what the *minimum* number of images should be and the swapchain will have provisioned its images including however many additional images it deems necessary to work internally. We need to generate an *image view* for each *image* in the swapchain in order to interact with them later.

The documentation explains what an *image view* is: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#resources-image-views](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#resources-image-views) - basically we can't directly use a *vk::Image*, instead we must use a complementary *vk::ImageView* to interact with them.

Our swapchain wrapper class will need to hold a list of these image views - one for each image in the swapchain. To represent a Vulkan image view, we will create another wrapper class. Create `vulkan-image-view.hpp` and `vulkan-image-view.cpp` in our Vulkan application source folder. Enter the following into the header:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanImageView
    {
        VulkanImageView(const vk::Device& device,
                        const vk::Image& image,
                        const vk::Format& format,
                        const vk::ImageAspectFlags& aspectFlags,
                        const uint32_t& mipLevels);

        const vk::ImageView& getImageView() const;

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

The image view will actually be generated by the *device*, using the other arguments to fill in its configuration info. Edit the implementation with the following:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-image-view.hpp"

using ast::VulkanImageView;

namespace
{
    vk::UniqueImageView createImageView(const vk::Device& device,
                                        const vk::Image& image,
                                        const vk::Format& format,
                                        const vk::ImageAspectFlags& aspectFlags,
                                        const uint32_t& mipLevels)
    {
        vk::ImageSubresourceRange subresourceRangeInfo{
            aspectFlags, // Flags
            0,           // Base mip level
            mipLevels,   // Mip level count
            0,           // Base array layer
            1            // Layer count
        };

        vk::ImageViewCreateInfo createInfo{
            vk::ImageViewCreateFlags(), // Flags
            image,                      // Image
            vk::ImageViewType::e2D,     // View type
            format,                     // Format
            vk::ComponentMapping(),     // Components
            subresourceRangeInfo        // Subresource range
        };

        return device.createImageViewUnique(createInfo);
    }
} // namespace

struct VulkanImageView::Internal
{
    const vk::UniqueImageView imageView;

    Internal(const vk::Device& device,
             const vk::Image& image,
             const vk::Format& format,
             const vk::ImageAspectFlags& aspectFlags,
             const uint32_t& mipLevels)
        : imageView(::createImageView(device, image, format, aspectFlags, mipLevels)) {}
};

VulkanImageView::VulkanImageView(const vk::Device& device,
                                 const vk::Image& image,
                                 const vk::Format& format,
                                 const vk::ImageAspectFlags& aspectFlags,
                                 const uint32_t& mipLevels)
    : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>(device, image, format, aspectFlags, mipLevels)) {}

const vk::ImageView& VulkanImageView::getImageView() const
{
    return internal->imageView.get();
}
```

There is *lots* of boilerplate in the implementation, the interesting part is the `createImageView` free function which constructs a configuration object then asks the device to generate a new *unique* image view object from it. You might be wondering why we are passing in the `mipLevels` argument since we've never talked about it before - in a later article we will add mip mapping and it will be handy to have integrated this now rather than refactoring a heap of code later to accommodate it.

Save the implementation and hop back to `vulkan-swapchain.hpp`. Add the following headers to give us access to our new class and to be able to use `std::vector`:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-image-view.hpp"
#include <vector>
```

Also add a new public function definition so we can expose the list of image views (this will be important later):

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain
{
    ...

    const std::vector<ast::VulkanImageView>& getImageViews() const;
```

 Edit the implementation again and add the following new field, constructed with a `createImageViews` function which we'll write:

```cpp
struct VulkanSwapchain::Internal
{
    ...

    const std::vector<ast::VulkanImageView> imageViews;

    Internal(...)
        : ...
          imageViews(::createImageViews(device, swapchain.get(), format)) {}
```

Before we implement the `createImageViews` function, add the public `getImageViews` implementation to the bottom of the file:

```cpp
const std::vector<ast::VulkanImageView>& VulkanSwapchain::getImageViews() const
{
    return internal->imageViews;
}
```

Now for the `createImageViews` function, add the following to the anonymous namespace:

```cpp
namespace
{
    ...

    std::vector<ast::VulkanImageView> createImageViews(const ast::VulkanDevice& device,
                                                       const vk::SwapchainKHR& swapChain,
                                                       const VulkanSwapchainFormat& format)
    {
        std::vector<ast::VulkanImageView> imageViews;

        // For each of the images in the swap chain, we need to create a new 'image view'.
        for (const vk::Image& image : device.getDevice().getSwapchainImagesKHR(swapChain))
        {
            ast::VulkanImageView imageView{
                device.getDevice(),
                image,
                format.colorFormat,
                vk::ImageAspectFlagBits::eColor,
                1};

            imageViews.push_back(std::move(imageView));
        }

        return imageViews;
    }
}
```

We ask the device to give us the collection of images used by the swapchain instance, iterating them and creating a new `ast::VulkanImageView` for each one. The image views are added to the list as they are created - using `std::move` because under the hood they are our `internal_ptr` component which is only movable (not copyable). We specify a `mipLevel` of 1 because each frame buffer should not generate mip maps.

Run the application once again and though nothing visually has changed, we know that our swapchain is ready to rock!

> Important: There is an implementation scenario I haven't covered yet where we would need to *recreate* our swapchain at runtime. One of the triggers for doing this is on window size change events where the properties of the existing swapchain become invalid. We will tackle this topic later once we have a rendering loop, as it is likely to be the first point in time where it would cause us a problem.

<hr/>

## Summary

Setting up the swapchain was a fairly chunky piece of work, it is represents what I feel is the *flavour* of writing Vulkan code - in that it really does expect you to micro manage many of the details that technologies like OpenGL have historically hidden away.

Our next article will continue to build upon the swapchain to add a *render context* to our Vulkan application.
