Now that we have onboarded all our platform targets we can start concentrating more on authoring our C++ application code. As hinted at in the previous article, the code we have written so far will get our app up and running, but some parts are actually a bit smelly.

The goals of this article are:

- Add a logging class so we can ensure any console output only happens in debug builds, and all platforms receive the output.
- Adopt a C++ pattern that will allow us to use smart pointers and better encapsulate implementation code from header files.
- Model a basic `application` class which knows how to run the main loop we made but doesn't prescribe the graphics technology to use.
- Use our `application` concept to model an OpenGL application - with a view that at a later point we would also have a Vulkan application.
- Encapsulate the code that is currently in the `main.cpp` class into an `engine` class, which will be responsible for resolving the correct `application` and running it.

<!-- excerpt -->

> Note: I will use the term `class` a lot, but in fact most of the objects we will write will syntactically be `structs`.

So, crack open Visual Studio Code, open our `a-simple-triangle-workspace` and hop into the CMake view. We can make all of these changes using our `console` application which is one of the main reasons we wrote it. Using our console application will make the C++ coding quite fast to iterate compared to other platforms which have heavy startup overheads to see code changes.

> Note: Don't forget, whenever we add new source files we need to press the small CMake icon (next to the little hammer icon) in Visual Studio Code so it refreshes and picks up the new files. Burn this action into your grey matter because I will be assuming that you do this as we add source files. Remember also when revisiting the iOS and MacOS platforms that we need to run their `setup.sh` scripts to pick up file additions or removals as well. Android and Emscripten don't need to do this because their `CMakeLists.txt` rules should automatically pick up new code.

<hr/>

## Logging class

In our `main.cpp` class, we had a simple `std::cout` statement to print some output to the console. There are a couple of problems with this:

1. We don't really *want* to print output in `release` builds - only `debug` builds; and
2. `std::cout` on its own doesn't even show up by default on Android.

Let's add a new class that does the following:

- If we are in a `debug` build, emit the output as normal, otherwise don't do anything.
- If we are on Android in `debug` mode, use the Android logging APIs to print to the Android [Logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat) system.

Add the following new files:

- `main/src/core/log.hpp`
- `main/src/core/log.cpp`

> Remember in Visual Studio Code: `File -> New` then `Save`.

Edit the `log.hpp` header:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <string>

namespace ast
{
    void log(const std::string& tag, const std::string& message);

    void log(const std::string& tag, const std::string& message, const std::exception& error);
} // namespace ast
```

This header gives us two logging methods in the `ast` namespace. They are *free functions* (are not member functions of any object) so we don't need an instance of any type to call them. For example, any code that has imported the header file would log a message like this:

```cpp
ast::log("TAG", "Some output message");
```

Edit the 'log.cpp' source:

```cpp
#ifndef NDEBUG
#ifdef __ANDROID__
#include <android/log.h>
#endif
#endif

#include "log.hpp"
#include <iostream>

void ast::log(const std::string& tag, const std::string& message)
{
#ifndef NDEBUG
#ifdef __ANDROID__
    __android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG, "a-simple-triangle", "%s: %s", tag.c_str(), message.c_str());
#else
    std::cout << tag << ": " << message << std::endl;
#endif
#endif
}

void ast::log(const std::string& tag, const std::string& message, const std::exception& error)
{
#ifndef NDEBUG
    std::string output = message + " Exception message was: " + std::string{error.what()};
    ast::log(tag, output);
#endif
}
```

Consider the conditional we are using in this code:

```cpp
#ifndef NDEBUG
...
#endif
```

The conditional will only evaluate if we are in a debug build. By wrapping blocks of code with this conditional, it won't even be compiled into the application if it is not in debug mode.

As you can see, by using this conditional the log methods actually don't do anything if we are not in a debug build.

This code also detects `__ANDROID__` and routes the logging text through the Android logging system instead of `std::cout`, because by default `std::cout` messages don't appear in `Logcat`.

<hr/>

## Adopt the PIMPL pattern

For some of the non trivial classes, I will be using a basic form of the `Pointer to IMPLementation`, or `PIMPL` pattern. Here are some articles about it:

- [https://cpppatterns.com/patterns/pimpl.html](https://cpppatterns.com/patterns/pimpl.html)
- [https://lattix.com/blog/2017/04/21/reduce-c-build-times-part-2-pimpl-idiom](https://lattix.com/blog/2017/04/21/reduce-c-build-times-part-2-pimpl-idiom)
- [https://www.bfilipek.com/2018/01/pimpl.html](https://www.bfilipek.com/2018/01/pimpl.html)
- [http://oliora.github.io/2015/12/29/pimpl-and-rule-of-zero.html](http://oliora.github.io/2015/12/29/pimpl-and-rule-of-zero.html)

We will write a simple *move semantic* only PIMPL implementation that is similar to one demonstrated in the last web link above. We will name this `internal_ptr` - I just really can't stand seeing the word `pimpl` in my code.

Using this pattern allows us to have an *internal* object that forms the *private implementation* of a class, hiding all the private guts of a class from its public API. Our approach will use the basic functionality of the `std::unique_ptr` type - so only *move semantics* will be possible. Add a new file `main/src/core/internal_ptr.hpp` with the following code:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <memory>

namespace ast
{
    namespace internal_ptr_deleter
    {
        // 1. Custom deleter.
        template <class T>
        void deleter(T* victim)
        {
            delete victim;
        }
    } // namespace internal_ptr_deleter

    // 2. Template definition, alias of std::unique_ptr.
    template <class T, class Deleter = void (*)(T*)>
    using internal_ptr = std::unique_ptr<T, Deleter>;

    // 3. Factory to create an internal_ptr instance.
    template <class T, class... Args>
    inline internal_ptr<T> make_internal_ptr(Args&&... args)
    {
        return internal_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...), &internal_ptr_deleter::deleter<T>);
    }
} // namespace ast
```

1. The custom deleter template is needed to ensure that an `internal_ptr` based object will automatically self destroy upon going out of scope.
2. The template definition that gives us the `internal_ptr` type. Basically it is just an alias to a `std::unique_ptr` with a custom deleter signature.
3. The factory method is used to create a new instance of an `internal_ptr` type. The factory method will forward all its arguments on to the target object constructor.

We'll make use of the `internal_ptr` quite liberally as we go forward.

<hr/>

## Decouple OpenGL code

By the end of this series we would like to use OpenGL *or* Vulkan depending on which technology is available at run time. At the moment, our code base is fairly tightly coupled to use OpenGL. This won't be too helpful when we want to use Vulkan down the track.

We will model a basic `application` which can then have different implementations - an OpenGL implementation, and later when we get to it, a Vulkan implementation. Once we have these `applications`, our code can try to pick the best one it can. For now, we will focus on moving our OpenGL code into an OpenGL application, starting with a base application class.

Create two new source files in `main/src/application` (you will need to create the `application` folder under `main/src`):

- application.hpp
- application.cpp

Edit the `application.hpp` file with:

```cpp
#pragma once

namespace ast
{
    struct Application
    {
        Application() = default;

        virtual ~Application() = default;

        void startApplication();

        bool runMainLoop();

        virtual void render() = 0;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

The header defines some basic functions that would be common to both OpenGL or Vulkan (or probably other technologies too). By declaring an abstract `render()` function (because it is marked `virtual` and is assigned a value of `0`), we have effectively made this a base class.

Notice also that we are declaring the `startApplication()` and `runMainLoop()` functions - we are going to shift all the non OpenGL code in our `main.cpp` file into the implementation of the application class. This will include the conditional logic to correctly start Emscripten, as well as the main event looping code. We will also make a tweak to how we start the Emscripten main loop.

Edit the `application.cpp` file with:

```cpp
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
#include <emscripten.h>
#endif

#include "../core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"
#include "application.hpp"

using ast::Application;

namespace
{
#ifdef EMSCRIPTEN
    void emscriptenMainLoop(ast::Application* application)
    {
        application->runMainLoop();
    }
#endif
} // namespace

void Application::startApplication()
{
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
    emscripten_set_main_loop_arg((em_arg_callback_func) ::emscriptenMainLoop, this, 60, 1);
#else
    while (runMainLoop())
    {
        // Just waiting for the main loop to end.
    }
#endif
}

bool Application::runMainLoop()
{
    SDL_Event event;

    // Each loop we will process any events that are waiting for us.
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&event))
    {
        switch (event.type)
        {
            case SDL_QUIT:
                return false;

            case SDL_KEYDOWN:
                if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_ESCAPE)
                {
                    return false;
                }
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }

    // Perform our rendering for this frame.
    render();

    return true;
}
```

Points of interest:

Notice that we have the conditional Emscripten header include at the top.

We have declared the `emscriptenMainLoop` function as a free function in an anonymous namespace private to this file. Notice also that it now takes an argument of type `ast::Application* application`. This is how we can give our Emscripten main loop something contextual, in this case the instance of the application that should be controlled by the main loop.

To invoke the `emscriptenMainLoop` we are now using a slightly different variant of the `emscripten_set_main_loop` function:

```cpp
emscripten_set_main_loop_arg((em_arg_callback_func) ::emscriptenMainLoop, this, 60, 1);
```

The first argument specifies which method Emscripten should invoke on every main loop iteration, cast to the `em_arg_callback_func` type which is defined as:

```cpp
typedef void (*em_arg_callback_func)(void*)
```

This means that the function we pass in, must take one argument of type `void*` which pretty much means it can be a pointer to whatever we like.

> Note: The `::` preceeding the `::emscriptenMainLoop` argument is a way to explicitly call a method in the anonymous namespace in the current file. It isn't strictly needed but I like using it to make it clear about where the function is located and disambiguate it from a class member function.

The second argument represents the argument we want to pass into the function, so we specify `this` to send our current `Application` instance to the function. This is how we are allowed to pass the argument `ast::Application* application` then call the `runMainLoop()` method upon it:

```cpp
void emscriptenMainLoop(ast::Application* application)
{
    application->runMainLoop();
}
```

The third and fourth arguments are the same as before.

## OpenGL application

Now that we have a base application we can create our OpenGL application variant and move all our tightly coupled OpenGL code into it.

Create the following new files in `main/src/application/opengl` (you will need to create the `opengl` folder):

- opengl-application.hpp
- opengl-application.cpp

The `opengl-application` will subclass our new `application` class, meaning it will inherit the existing main loop code and basic event handling. The only thing our OpenGL variant needs to do is implement the ability to `render` something each frame.

Edit `opengl-application.hpp` to:

> Note: This will be our first use of the `internal_ptr` we made earlier.

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"
#include "../application.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct OpenGLApplication : public ast::Application
    {
        OpenGLApplication();
        void render() override;

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

The header is fairly straight forward, we are extending the `ast::Application` base class, declaring that we are implementing the `render` function and applying our `internal_ptr` pattern to hide the implementation from the public API.

Edit `opengl-application.cpp` to:

```cpp
#include "opengl-application.hpp"
#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/log.hpp"
#include "../../core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"
#include <string>

using ast::OpenGLApplication;

namespace
{
    SDL_GLContext createContext(SDL_Window* window)
    {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::OpenGLApplication::createContext"};

        SDL_GLContext context{SDL_GL_CreateContext(window)};

#ifdef WIN32
        glewInit();
#endif

        int viewportWidth;
        int viewportHeight;
        SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(window, &viewportWidth, &viewportHeight);
        ast::log(logTag, "Created OpenGL context with viewport size: " + std::to_string(viewportWidth) + " x " + std::to_string(viewportHeight));

        glClearDepthf(1.0f);
        glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
        glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL);
        glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
        glViewport(0, 0, viewportWidth, viewportHeight);

        return context;
    }
} // namespace

struct OpenGLApplication::Internal
{
    SDL_Window* window;
    SDL_GLContext context;

    Internal() : window(ast::sdl::createWindow(SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)),
                 context(::createContext(window)) {}

    void render()
    {
        SDL_GL_MakeCurrent(window, context);

        glClearColor(0.3f, 0.7f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

        SDL_GL_SwapWindow(window);
    }

    ~Internal()
    {
        SDL_GL_DeleteContext(context);
        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    }
};

OpenGLApplication::OpenGLApplication() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}

void OpenGLApplication::render()
{
    internal->render();
}
```

Let's step through this implementation a piece at a time. A lot of it looks very similar to the code in our `main.cpp` file so parts of it should feel familiar.

**Create OpenGL context function**

We have a free function `createContext` that simply creates the OpenGL context we need and does some basic OpenGL setup. This code is somewhat similar to the code in the `runApplication` function of `main.cpp`, except that it returns the context to the caller and we have changed the approach to computing the viewport size.

The viewport size calculation has changed because on some platforms such as iOS the actual renderable size might be at a higher DPI than the reported display size. Typically on iOS retina devices the renderable size would be twice the size of the display size. If we didn't change this then our application would only render at a quarter of the screen size on iOS retina devices. The `SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize` function gives us the true size which our viewport needs in order to fill the screen.

```cpp
namespace
{
    SDL_GLContext createContext(SDL_Window* window)
    {
        static const std::string logTag{"ast::OpenGLApplication::createContext"};

        SDL_GLContext context{SDL_GL_CreateContext(window)};

#ifdef WIN32
        glewInit();
#endif

        int viewportWidth;
        int viewportHeight;
        SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(window, &viewportWidth, &viewportHeight);
        ast::log(logTag, "Created OpenGL context with viewport size: " + std::to_string(viewportWidth) + " x " + std::to_string(viewportHeight));

        glClearDepthf(1.0f);
        glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
        glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL);
        glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
        glViewport(0, 0, viewportWidth, viewportHeight);

        return context;
    }
} // namespace
```

**Internal implementation**

This is the implementation of our `Internal` struct that was forward declared in the header file and encapsulated within our `internal_ptr` mechanism. Notice that it has the `window` and `context` member fields which means they are now nicely tucked away instead of sitting in global scope like we had them in `main.cpp`.

The constructor will initialise both the window and the context. Note we have added a new window flag named `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI`. If we didn't add this flag then iOS retina devices would only render at half their actual renderable size which results in an upscaled low resolution image. This flag is related to the change we made to calculate the viewport correctly and is necessary on high DPI devices.

The destructor will clean up our OpenGL window and context.

The `render` function will simply do the same thing we were already doing - displaying a (*yes very boring, I promise we will start showing something more interesting soon enough!*) green screen.

```cpp
struct OpenGLApplication::Internal
{
    SDL_Window* window;
    SDL_GLContext context;

    Internal() : window(ast::sdl::createWindow(SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)),
                 context(::createContext(window)) {}

    void render()
    {
        SDL_GL_MakeCurrent(window, context);

        glClearColor(0.3f, 0.7f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

        SDL_GL_SwapWindow(window);
    }

    ~Internal()
    {
        SDL_GL_DeleteContext(context);
        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    }
};
```

**Public API implementation**

The public functions in our header that we must implement are:

1. The constructor, whose job it is to create the instance of our private `internal` member field.
2. The `render` function, which will simply defer to our internal implementation.

```cpp
OpenGLApplication::OpenGLApplication() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}

void OpenGLApplication::render()
{
    internal->render();
}
```

Notice how the constructor is initialising the `internal` member field like this:

```cpp
internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>())
```

The `make_internal_ptr` is our factory method we wrote in the `internal_ptr` template file. In this class our `Internal` struct doesn't need any constructor arguments, but if it did, they would be passed into the `make_internal_ptr` function which would **forward** them on.

<hr/>

## Engine wrapper

So we have a new OpenGL application class, but we haven't yet touched our `main.cpp` file to use it. Instead of our `main.cpp` file directly creating a new instance of an `OpenGLApplication`, we will write another class whose responsibility is to selectively bootstrap the correct application, then run it and own its lifecycle including its destruction.

For this we will write a new class named `Engine`, after which we will clean up our `main.cpp` file such that all it does is create an instance of our `Engine` and ask it to run.

Create new source files under `main/src/core` named:

- `engine.hpp`
- `engine.cpp`

First, the header file. There isn't much in the header, which if nothing else illustrates the `internal_ptr` pattern we are using. We just want a constructor and one public method named `run`:

Edit the `engine.hpp` with the following:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "internal-ptr.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct Engine
    {
        Engine();

        void run();

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

Edit the `engine.cpp` with the following:

```cpp
#include "engine.hpp"
#include "../application/application.hpp"
#include "../application/opengl/opengl-application.hpp"
#include "log.hpp"
#include "sdl-wrapper.hpp"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

using ast::Engine;

struct Engine::Internal
{
    const std::string classLogTag;

    Internal() : classLogTag("ast::Engine::") {}

    void run()
    {
        static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "run"};

        ast::log(logTag, "Starting engine ...");
        SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS);
        ast::log(logTag, "SDL2 initialized successfully ...");
        resolveApplication()->startApplication();
    }

    std::unique_ptr<ast::Application> resolveApplication()
    {
        static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "resolveApplication"};

        try
        {
            ast::log(logTag, "Creating OpenGL application ...");
            return std::make_unique<ast::OpenGLApplication>();
        }
        catch (const std::exception& error)
        {
            ast::log(logTag, "OpenGL application failed to initialize.", error);
        }

        throw std::runtime_error(logTag + " No applications can run in the current environment");
    }

    ~Internal()
    {
        SDL_Quit();
    }
};

Engine::Engine() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}

void Engine::run()
{
    internal->run();
}
```

Let's walk through the interesting parts of the `struct Engine::Internal`:

**Run function**

The `run` function simply initialises the basic SDL system, then proceeds to obtain an instance of an `application` to start by invoking the `resolveApplication` function.

```cpp
void run()
{
    static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "run"};

    ast::log(logTag, "Starting engine ...");
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS);
    ast::log(logTag, "SDL2 initialized successfully ...");
    resolveApplication()->startApplication();
}
```

**Resolve application function**

The `resolveApplication` function will attempt to initialise each `application` that we want to support - to begin with we only have OpenGL but later we will introduce the Vulkan application as well.

We are using exception handling to give us a non fatal control flow if a desired application cannot be initialised. This will become far more important when we integrate Vulkan, where it is generally not possible to know ahead of time if the myriad of Vulkan configuration steps will succeed.

Of course, if none of our supported application variants can be initialised then we don't have a lot of options so we will throw a meaningful exception instead and bomb out.

Note also that we are using a `unique_ptr` smart pointer as a return value so it will self destruct upon leaving its containing scope. We are also returning a type of `ast::Application` although the actual selected implementation is `ast::OpenGLApplication` (and in the future could be a Vulkan application).

There is also a smattering of logging with our logging mechanism, including the use case of passing an exception through for logging.

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<ast::Application> resolveApplication()
{
    static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "resolveApplication"};

    try
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "Creating OpenGL application ...");
        return std::make_unique<ast::OpenGLApplication>();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& error)
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "OpenGL application failed to initialize.", error);
    }

    throw std::runtime_error(logTag + " No applications can run in the current environment");
}
```

**Internal destructor**

The internal destructor is pretty simple, it just tries to be a good citizen and shut down the SDL system gracefully.

```cpp
~Internal()
{
    SDL_Quit();
}
```

**Public API - constructor**

The public constructor is quite basic and you will see this pattern repeated a lot. It's pretty much same as before - our public constructor simply creates a new instance of our `Internal` struct via our `internal_ptr` mechanism.

```cpp
Engine::Engine() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}
```

**Public API - run function**

The public `run` function simply defers to the internal implementation. This is how most of our public functions will operate - by deferring to the internal implementation.

```cpp
void Engine::run()
{
    internal->run();
}
```

<hr/>

## Clean up time!

After all that we can finally revisit the `main.cpp` file and remove almost everything from it, leaving it with the simple responsibility of creating an instance of our `Engine` and running it.

Edit the `main.cpp` file to this:

```cpp
#include "core/engine.hpp"
#include "core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"

int main(int, char* [])
{
    ast::Engine().run();
    return 0;
}
```

Pretty massive change yeah? An instance of our engine is both created and run with this line:

```cpp
ast::Engine().run();
```

There is one **very** important detail in this new `main.cpp` file: the `#include "core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"` **MUST** be included here, as it will reconfigure the `main` entry point of the application to actually bootstrap the SDL foundation automatically on certain platforms. If the header is not included here, you will find that platforms such as Android will fail. The related code can be found in the `SDL_main.h` from the SDL library and looks like this:

```cpp
#if defined(SDL_MAIN_NEEDED) || defined(SDL_MAIN_AVAILABLE)
#define main    SDL_main
#endif
```

## Drum roll please!

Run your application again and you should see the familiar window filled with green. In the `DEBUG CONSOLE` area you will see our logging statements (amongst all the framework logs) that would look something like:

```
ast::Engine::run: Starting engine ...
ast::Engine::run: SDL2 initialized successfully ...
ast::Engine::resolveApplication: Creating OpenGL application ...
ast::OpenGLApplication::createContext: Created OpenGL context with display size: 640 x 480
```

At this point you could go and run each of our target platforms to see that they are all still working. As a reminder, here is how to do each (of course we just ran the `console` application so no need to explain that).

**Emscripten**

- Navigate to the `emscripten` folder in Terminal.
- No need to run `setup.sh` unless you've never done that before.
- Run `./build.sh`.

**Android**

- No need to run the `setup.sh` in the `android` folder unless you've never done it before.
- Open the Android project in Android Studio and click the run button.

**MacOS**

- Navigate to the `macos` folder in Terminal.
- Run `./setup.sh` - remember this is needed to regenerate the Xcode project files.
- Open the MacOS Xcode project in Xcode and press the play button.

**iOS**

- Navigate to the `ios` folder in Terminal.
- Run `./setup.sh` - remember this is needed to regenerate the Xcode project files.
- Open the iOS Xcode project in Xcode and press the play button.

**Windows**

- No need to run `setup.ps1` unless you've never done that before.
- Open the folder in Visual Studio and run the solution.

## Summary

The refactored code feels a bit cleaner than the mash of code we had before and gives us a few handy mechanisms to start building out some more interesting parts of our engine.

I'm not sure about you but I am getting rather tired of the plain green screen, so next up we will learn a way to load a 3D model from storage and with the goal of rendering it.

[The code for this article can be found here.](https://github.com/MarcelBraghetto/a-simple-triangle/tree/master/part-08-refactor-round-1)
