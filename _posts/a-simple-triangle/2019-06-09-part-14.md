<img src="/images/ast/part-14/result.png" />

Our Mac console will be the first target to setup Vulkan, though incidentally it will be via the MoltenVK library which gives us the ability to use the Vulkan SDK on Mac and iOS. In this article we will:

- Write some setup scripts to download the Vulkan SDK for Mac.
- Learn how to integrate the Vulkan SDK into our console platform target.
- Author the first slice of our `VulkanApplication` class which will be a sibling to our existing `OpenGLApplication` class.
- Update our existing `Engine` class to try and initialise Vulkan, and fall back to OpenGL if it cannot.
- Be able to start the console app and see Vulkan intialise itself.

<!-- excerpt -->

> Note: During the Vulkan *setup* articles we will only go as far as initialising Vulkan - leaving the rest of the rendering implementation code until all platforms are able to run it.

<hr/>

## Setup script

We'll be writing some new setup scripts to download the Vulkan SDK for Mac and iOS from the official Vulkan SDK site: [https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home). We'll put the ability to download the SDK into our existing `shared-scripts.sh` as we have three targets that will need it - Mac console, Mac app, iOS.

Dust off your `shared-scripts.sh` file and add the following new method to download the SDK:

```sh
fetch_third_party_lib_vulkan_macos() {
    verify_third_party_folder_exists

    pushd ../../third-party
        if [ ! -d "vulkan-mac" ]; then
            echo "Fetching Vulkan SDK (Mac) from: https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/1.1.92.1/mac/vulkansdk-macos-1.1.92.1.tar.gz?Human=true"
            wget --no-cookies https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/1.1.92.1/mac/vulkansdk-macos-1.1.92.1.tar.gz?Human=true -O vulkan-mac.tar.gz
            echo "Unzipping Vulkan SDK (Mac) into 'third-party/vulkan-mac' ..."
            tar -xf vulkan-mac.tar.gz
            rm vulkan-mac.tar.gz
            mv vulkansdk-macos-1.1.92.1 vulkan-mac
        fi
    popd    
}
```

> Note: We are using version **1.1.92** deliberately - we want to be using as close to the same version of the Vulkan SDK across Mac, iOS, Android and Windows. Android in particular is not at the bleeding edge for its Vulkan support and the Android NDK version we will be using (version 20 as at the time of writing these articles) is bundled with its `vulkan.hpp` at version `90` which is close to the `92` that's available for other platforms. As time passes the Vulkan SDK could be updated across all platforms to a later version if needed.

This setup script looks similar to others we've already written - we check if there is a `vulkan-mac` folder in the `third-party` folder and if not go and fetch it.

The `wget` command is slightly different in that it has the `--no-cookies` argument because the download site tries to set cookies during the request. We also need the peculiar `?Human=true` - without this the download link seems to not work. We also use the `-O vulkan-mac.tar.gz` to tell `wget` to change the name of the downloaded file.

The file itself is not a `zip` file, but instead a `tar` file so we need to use the `tar` command to uncompress it.

Save and close the `shared-scripts.sh` file then edit the `setup.sh` script in your `console` folder, adding the new shared method invocation to the end of the script to fetch Vulkan:

```sh
fetch_third_party_lib_vulkan_macos
```

Now you can navigate into the `console` folder in Terminal and run the setup script:

```
$ ./setup.sh 
Fetching Brew dependency: 'wget'.
Fetching Brew dependency: 'cmake'.
Fetching Brew dependency: 'ninja'.
SDL library already exists in third party folder.
SDL2.framework already exists ...
Fetching Vulkan SDK (Mac) from: https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/1.1.92.1/mac/vulkansdk-macos-1.1.92.1.tar.gz?Human=true
Saving to: ‘vulkan-mac.tar.gz’
Unzipping Vulkan SDK (Mac) into 'third-party/vulkan-mac' ...
```

After running the script, observe that you now have a `vulkan-mac` folder in your `third-party` folder:

```
: root
 + third-party
   + vulkan-mac
```

Next we'll walk through what different bits of the SDK we'll need to integrate into our console project.

<hr/>

## Vulkan header files

The header files we will need to write our code against can be found here:

```
third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/include
```

There aren't too many of them and the main one we are interested in is the `vulkan.hpp` file which provides the C++ interface to the Vulkan SDK. There is also a `vulkan.h` file for the C based interface.

We need to add the header location to our `CMakeLists.txt` file so they are included for us in our code base. Open `console/CMakeLists.txt` and add the following definition to the `include_directories` section to include the Vulkan headers:

```cmake
include_directories(${THIRD_PARTY_DIR}/vulkan-mac/macOS/include)
```

<hr/>

## Dynamic library files

We will be using the following dynamic library files that come bundled with the SDK - note that there is one main file for Vulkan integration but also another one for MoltenVK support:

```
third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/lib/libvulkan.1.1.92.dylib
third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/lib/libMoltenVK.dylib
```

We'll be placing these two files in our `console/Frameworks` folder so they can be found at runtime and we'll be linking them during the build. The Vulkan system will actually be looking for a file named `libvulkan.1.dylib` so we'll also need to do a file naming change as well.

Open the `shared-scripts.sh` file again and add the following at the end:

```sh
setup_vulkan_libs_macos() {
    verify_frameworks_folder_exists

    pushd "Frameworks"
        if [ ! -e "libvulkan.1.dylib" ]; then
            cp ../../../third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/lib/libvulkan.1.1.92.dylib libvulkan.1.dylib
        fi

        if [ ! -e "libMoltenVK.dylib" ]; then
            cp ../../../third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/lib/libMoltenVK.dylib libMoltenVK.dylib
        fi
    popd
}
```

This script will check that we have a `Frameworks` folder, then check that we have the two dynamic library files that we require. Note that the first `cp` command renames `libvulkan.1.1.92.dylib` to `libvulkan.1.dylib` on the way through - if we didn't do this then Vulkan would fail to initialise.

Save and close the `shared-scripts.sh` file and edit your `console/setup.sh` again, adding the following to the bottom:

```sh
setup_vulkan_libs_macos
```

Save and exit then run `setup.sh` in your `console` folder. After running it you will see your folder structure look like this:

```
: root
  + console
    + Frameworks
      libMoltenVK.dylib
      libvulkan.1.dylib
```

As well as copying the `dylib` files we need to register them in our `CMakeLists.txt` file to *link* them with our executable.

In the `console/CMakeLists.txt` file add the following lines just before the `add_executable` block to declare build variables representing the two `dylib` files we need to link:

```cmake
set(DYLIB_VULKAN ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Frameworks/libvulkan.1.dylib)
set(DYLIB_MOLTEN_VK ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib)
```

Then just before the `add_custom_command` block, add the following to cause the `dylib` files to be linked to our main build target:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(
    a-simple-triangle-console
    ${DYLIB_VULKAN}
    ${DYLIB_MOLTEN_VK}
)
```

If we don't link these libraries to our target our compilation will fail.

<hr/>

## MoltenVK ICD

Vulkan supports `Installable Client Drivers` or `ICD`s. To get Vulkan to run on Apple platforms we actually need to use the MoltenVK ICD. Here is a bit of info to explain what an `ICD` needs to do: [https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.0.54.0/windows/LoaderAndLayerInterface.html#user-content-installable-client-drivers](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.0.54.0/windows/LoaderAndLayerInterface.html#user-content-installable-client-drivers). And here is the official MoltenVK site: [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK).

When our application tries to initialise Vulkan, it will check to see if there are any ICDs it should use. In the Vulkan SDK for MacOS there is actually a bundled JSON definition that uses the MoltenVK ICD, which we can use as a clue on how to configure our own `ICD`:

```
third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json
```

If you examine the content of the `MoltenVK_icd.json` file you will see this:

```json
{
    "file_format_version" : "1.0.0",
    "ICD": {
        "library_path": "../../../lib/libMoltenVK.dylib",
        "api_version" : "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

The `api_version` represents Vulkan 1.0.0 - which is what MoltenVK is aligned with - and the `library_path` defines a relative location to find the `ICD` dynamic library to use at run time - observe that it points at the `libMoltenVK.dylib` file within the main Vulkan SDK folder.

We need to replicate this ICD configuration for our console target by adding a `vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json` file which has a `library_path` pointing into our `console/Frameworks` folder.

We won't copy the one from the Vulkan SDK - the `library_path` wouldn't work for us anyway - we will just create our own `MoltenVK_icd.json` file under a `vulkan/icd.d` folder within our `console` folder.

> Important: Vulkan will look for a folder named `vulkan/icd.d` in the same location as the executable - if it isn't in exactly that path it won't find it and therefore Vulkan will fail to initialise for MoltenVK based platforms.

To include a MoltenVK ICD in our console project, create a file named `MoltenVK_icd.json` in the following folder structure - you'll need to create the `vulkan/icd.d` folders too. We only need to do this once so you can check this new file into version control afterward:

```
: root
  + console
    + vulkan
      + icd.d
        MoltenVK_icd.json
```

Edit `MoltenVK_icd.json` with the following content then close it - noting that the `library_path` points down into our `Frameworks` folder to find the MoltenVK dynamic library which is the implementation of the ICD for MacOS:

```json
{
    "file_format_version" : "1.0.0",
    "ICD": {
        "library_path": "../../Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib",
        "api_version" : "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

We will need to make sure this new `vulkan` folder is available within the `out` folder after a build so Vulkan within our application executable can find it when it starts - remember it will be looking for a `vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json` path to boostrap Vulkan. We will use a symlink again, very similar to how we included the `assets` folder. Edit `console/cmake-post-build.sh` and update it to look like the following:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Adding Frameworks @rpath to binary ..."
install_name_tool -add_rpath @loader_path/../Frameworks out/a-simple-triangle-console

pushd out
    # See if there is an `assets` folder already.
    if [ ! -d "assets" ]; then
        # If there isn't create a new symlink named `assets`.
        echo "Linking 'assets' path to '../../main/assets'"
        ln -s ../../main/assets assets
    fi

    # See if there is a `vulkan` folder already.
    if [ ! -d "vulkan" ]; then
        # If there isn't create a new symlink named `vulkan`.
        echo "Linking 'vulkan' path to '../vulkan'"
        ln -s ../vulkan vulkan
    fi
popd
```

Note the addition of the `vulkan` folder check and symlink setup near the bottom - the rest of the script hasn't changed.

Perform a CMake refresh then if you run your project now you will find a new `vulkan` symlink in the `out` folder.

<hr/>

## Creating the Vulkan application

Before adding our new Vulkan application we need to update our graphics wrapper and SDL wrapper headers to import the Vulkan C++ dependencies. Once we do this, the Vulkan APIs will become available in our code base since we previously included them in our `CMakeLists.txt` file.

First off, edit `main/src/core/graphics-wrapper.hpp` and add the Vulkan header include statement within the `__APPLE__` block - the `vulkan.hpp` file is the C++ Vulkan wrapper header since we would prefer it over the C style APIs found in `vulkan.h`:

```cpp
#elif __APPLE__
#include <vulkan/vulkan.hpp>

...
```

> Note: There are advantages to using the C++ vs the C header for Vulkan, a key one is the access to a range of `Unique*` Vulkan class variants that basically act like smart pointers and clean themselves up when they go out of scope. If we were to use the C header instead, it would force us to do all the memory clean up manually - and tediously - which is error prone and requires heaps of boilerplate code to run at the correct points in time. The C++ Vulkan header is actually just a wrapper over the top of the C header with some helpful components to allow us to write more C++ styled code.

Next we'll add some of the built in SDL Vulkan functionality to expose some Vulkan related SDL APIs that we'll need. Edit `main/src/core/sdl-wrapper.hpp` and add the following include statement:

```cpp
#include <SDL_vulkan.h>
```

Our Vulkan application and associated classes will live in a new folder named `main/src/application/vulkan`. Create it now then within it create the files `vulkan-application.hpp` and `vulkan-application.cpp`.

Edit `vulkan-application.hpp` with the following:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"
#include "../application.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanApplication : public ast::Application
    {
        VulkanApplication();

        void update(const float& delta) override;

        void render() override;

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

The header looks almost identical to the existing `opengl-application.hpp` header.

Now edit `vulkan-application.cpp` to add the skeleton of our implementation:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-application.hpp"
#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"
#include "vulkan-context.hpp"

using ast::VulkanApplication;

struct VulkanApplication::Internal
{
    const ast::VulkanContext context;
    SDL_Window* window;

    Internal() : context(ast::VulkanContext()),
                 window(ast::sdl::createWindow(SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN | SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)) {}

    void update(const float& delta) {}

    void render() {}

    ~Internal()
    {
        if (window)
        {
            SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
        }
    }
};

VulkanApplication::VulkanApplication() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}

void VulkanApplication::update(const float& delta)
{
    internal->update(delta);
}

void VulkanApplication::render()
{
    internal->render();
}
```

Our internal struct creates an SDL window in a very similar way to our OpenGL application, but passes in the `SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN` argument instead.

The `context` field will hold the Vulkan instance itself along with a bunch of state that it requires to run. We'll author the `VulkanContext` class next:

```cpp
const ast::VulkanContext context;
```

<hr/>

## The Vulkan context class

Unlike the OpenGL context from our OpenGL application, the Vulkan *context* is not part of any Vulkan SDK - it is completely our own invention. To use Vulkan in an application we need a Vulkan *instance*, which for us will be of the type `vk::UniqueInstance`. Once we have an *instance* we need to construct and configure **many** other Vulkan components before we can do anything useful with it. We are writing the context class as a tidy way to encapsulate the *instance* and all the other code that will follow for Vulkan setup.

Create the files `vulkan-context.hpp` and `vulkan-context.cpp` under `main/src/application/vulkan/`. Edit the header file with the following:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "../../core/internal-ptr.hpp"

namespace ast
{
    struct VulkanContext
    {
        VulkanContext();

    private:
        struct Internal;
        ast::internal_ptr<Internal> internal;
    };
} // namespace ast
```

Very standard stuff - actually nothing special at all about the header. Next edit the implementation file with the following:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-context.hpp"
#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/log.hpp"
#include "vulkan-common.hpp"

using ast::VulkanContext;

namespace
{
    vk::UniqueInstance createInstance()
    {
        vk::ApplicationInfo applicationInfo{
            "A Simple Triangle",      // Application name
            VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0), // Application version
            "A Simple Triangle",      // Engine name
            VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0), // Engine version
            VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0)  // Vulkan API version
        };

        // Find out what the mandatory Vulkan extensions are on the current device,
        // by this stage we would have already determined that the extensions are
        // available via the 'ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable()' call in our main engine.
        std::vector<std::string> requiredExtensionNames{
            ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()};

        // Pack the extension names into a data format consumable by Vulkan.
        std::vector<const char*> extensionNames;
        for (const auto& extension : requiredExtensionNames)
        {
            extensionNames.push_back(extension.c_str());
        }

        // Define the info for creating our Vulkan instance.
        vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo{
            vk::InstanceCreateFlags(),                    // Flags
            &applicationInfo,                             // Application info
            0,                                            // Enabled layer count
            nullptr,                                      // Enabled layer names
            static_cast<uint32_t>(extensionNames.size()), // Enabled extension count
            extensionNames.data()                         // Enabled extension names
        };

        // Build a new Vulkan instance from the configuration.
        return vk::createInstanceUnique(instanceCreateInfo);
    }
} // namespace

struct VulkanContext::Internal
{
    const vk::UniqueInstance instance;

    Internal() : instance(::createInstance())
    {
        ast::log("ast::VulkanContext", "Initialized Vulkan context successfully.");
    }
};

VulkanContext::VulkanContext() : internal(ast::make_internal_ptr<Internal>()) {}
```

> Note: You will get syntax errors as we haven't yet authored the `vulkan-common.hpp` header or its functions but don't worry we'll do that shortly.

Let's digest the implementation. Our `Internal` struct simply holds a Vulkan *instance* and initialises it through the `::createInstance()` free function. As previously mentioned, by using the `Unique*` variants of Vulkan classes we get automatic lifecycle management of them:

```cpp
struct VulkanContext::Internal
{
    const vk::UniqueInstance instance;

    Internal() : instance(::createInstance())
    {
        ast::log("ast::VulkanContext", "Initialized Vulkan context successfully.");
    }
};
```

The `::createInstance()` free function needs a bit of explaining. It starts off by creating a structure that describes our *application* to Vulkan. Most of the fields are up to us to decide on their values except the final API version which should reflect which version of Vulkan we are targetting:

```cpp
vk::ApplicationInfo applicationInfo{
    "A Simple Triangle",      // Application name
    VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0), // Application version
    "A Simple Triangle",      // Engine name
    VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0), // Engine version
    VK_MAKE_VERSION(1, 0, 0)  // Vulkan API version
};
```

> Note: Vulkan makes **very** heavy use of `Info` configuration structures to perform many of its operations. Get used to this style of creating a pile of info objects to perform Vulkan commands!

The next line is probably quite mysterious as we haven't actually written the `ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()` function yet.

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> requiredExtensionNames{
    ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()};
```

The function will return a list of what Vulkan extensions are required by the current device to operate successfully. For example on my Macbook Air the list of extensions required to create an instance successfully looks like this:

```
VK_KHR_surface
VK_MVK_macos_surface
```

The next block of code simply takes this vector of `std::string` extension names and converts them to vector of `const char*` so we can feed them into the subsequent Vulkan configuration which can't take `std::string` objects:

```cpp
std::vector<const char*> extensionNames;
for (const auto& extension : requiredExtensionNames)
{
    extensionNames.push_back(extension.c_str());
}
```

We use the `applicationInfo` object along with the extension names to form the configuration of the Vulkan instance we want to create:

```cpp
vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo{
    vk::InstanceCreateFlags(),                    // Flags
    &applicationInfo,                             // Application info
    0,                                            // Enabled layer count
    nullptr,                                      // Enabled layer names
    static_cast<uint32_t>(extensionNames.size()), // Enabled extension count
    extensionNames.data()                         // Enabled extension names
};
```

The final statement creates a new `vk::UniqueInstance` using the instance configuration object and returns it to the caller:

```cpp
return vk::createInstanceUnique(instanceCreateInfo);
```

The Vulkan instance forms the core of our implementation - we will be adding *many* more Vulkan configuration objects and data structures in the next bunch of articles to get ourselves into a state where we can actually render something - so hang in there!

<hr/>

## Vulkan common functions

We'll now author the `ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()` function used in our instance creation as a free function within the `ast::vulkan` namespace. We will write it as a free function as we'll need to use it again later in our implementation elsewhere.

Create `vulkan-common.hpp` and `vulkan-common.cpp` within the `main/src/application/vulkan` folder. We'll actually be authoring two functions, the `getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames` function but also another named `isVulkanAvailable` that can tell us whether or not we should even attempt to initialise Vulkan on the current device.

Edit `vulkan-common.hpp` with the following - noting that there is no `class` or `struct` definition, just free functions within the `ast::vulkan` namespace:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace ast::vulkan
{
    std::vector<std::string> getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames();

    bool isVulkanAvailable();
} // namespace ast::vulkan
```

Then edit `vulkan-common.cpp` with the following to implement the functions:

```cpp
#include "vulkan-common.hpp"
#include "../../core/graphics-wrapper.hpp"
#include "../../core/log.hpp"
#include "../../core/sdl-wrapper.hpp"
#include <set>

std::vector<std::string> ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()
{
    uint32_t extensionCount;
    SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(nullptr, &extensionCount, nullptr);

    auto extensionNames{std::make_unique<const char**>(new const char*[extensionCount])};
    SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(nullptr, &extensionCount, *extensionNames);
    std::vector<std::string> result(*extensionNames, *extensionNames + extensionCount);

    return result;
}

bool ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable()
{
    static const std::string logTag{"ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable"};

    // Check if SDL itself can load Vulkan.
    if (SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary(nullptr) != 0)
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "No SDL Vulkan support found.");
        return false;
    }

    // Determine what Vulkan extensions are required by SDL to be able to run Vulkan then pump
    // them into a 'set' so we can evaluate them easily.
    std::vector<std::string> requiredExtensionNamesSource{
        ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()};

    std::set<std::string> requiredExtensionNames(
        requiredExtensionNamesSource.begin(),
        requiredExtensionNamesSource.end());

    // There should always be required extensions so we should never get 0.
    if (requiredExtensionNames.empty())
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "No Vulkan required extensions found.");
        return false;
    }

    // Iterate all the available Vulkan extensions on the current device, draining
    // each one from the required extensions set along the way.
    for (auto const& availableExtension : vk::enumerateInstanceExtensionProperties())
    {
        requiredExtensionNames.erase(availableExtension.extensionName);
    }

    // If our required extensions set isn't empty it means that one or more of
    // them were not found in the available extensions, so we don't have what
    // we require to successfully create a Vulkan instance.
    if (!requiredExtensionNames.empty())
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "Missing one or more required Vulkan extensions.");
        return false;
    }

    ast::log(logTag, "Vulkan is available.");
    return true;
}
```

**getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames function**

This is the function we called to create the Vulkan instance earlier:

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()
```

First we need to query SDL to find out *how many* Vulkan extensions are *required* to support provisioning a Vulkan instance, asking for the result to be inserted into the `extensionCount` field:

```cpp
uint32_t extensionCount;
SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(nullptr, &extensionCount, nullptr);
```

We then query SDL a *second time*, using the `extensionCount` from the first query to extract the names of the required extensions. The double query seems very quirky but due to the way the SDL function operates we have to call the same `SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions` twice but parametised differently to get the different attributes. The SDL collection of extension names is in a format that isn't particularly friendly for us in C++ land so we need to coerce the result into a vector of `std::string` objects before returning it:

```cpp
auto extensionNames{std::make_unique<const char**>(new const char*[extensionCount])};
SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(nullptr, &extensionCount, *extensionNames);
std::vector<std::string> result(*extensionNames, *extensionNames + extensionCount);

return result;
```

**isVulkanAvailable**

This function will be used in our core engine shortly to evaluate whether there is any point in attempting to initialise Vulkan on the current device.

```cpp
bool ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable()
```

The first criteria is to query the SDL Vulkan implementation to find out if it can successfully start the Vulkan loader - for our Mac console this would mean bootstrapping the MoltenVK ICD. On other platforms such as Windows this might mean trying to locate and initialise the Vulkan graphics driver implementation. Of course if there isn't one, then Vulkan is pretty much not an option ...

```cpp
if (SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary(nullptr) != 0)
{
    ast::log(logTag, "No SDL Vulkan support found.");
    return false;
}
```

Next we use our `getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames` function to grab the collection of what Vulkan extensions must be supported on the device to be able to create a Vulkan instance. We then create a `set` populated with the collection of extension names to make it easier to evaluate how many of the required extensions are available.

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> requiredExtensionNamesSource{
    ast::vulkan::getRequiredVulkanExtensionNames()};

std::set<std::string> requiredExtensionNames(
    requiredExtensionNamesSource.begin(),
    requiredExtensionNamesSource.end());
```

The collection of required extensions should at a minimum contain more than zero elements - if for some reason there are *no* required extensions it is a sign that Vulkan probably can't be run on the device:

```cpp
if (requiredExtensionNames.empty())
{
    ast::log(logTag, "No Vulkan required extensions found.");
    return false;
}
```

The `set` of required extensions is then drained by all the currently *available* extensions that are reported via the result of the `vk::enumerateInstanceExtensionProperties()` command:

```cpp
for (auto const& availableExtension : vk::enumerateInstanceExtensionProperties())
{
    requiredExtensionNames.erase(availableExtension.extensionName);
}
```

If our `set` still contains any elements it means that there were *required extensions* that couldn't be found in the collection of *available extensions* - ultimately meaning that we don't in fact have the capability to successfully create a Vulkan instance:

```cpp
if (!requiredExtensionNames.empty())
{
    ast::log(logTag, "Missing one or more required Vulkan extensions.");
    return false;
}
```

If all our required extensions could be found then we are in business!

```cpp
ast::log(logTag, "Vulkan is available.");
return true;
```

Save your code and observe that the syntax errors should now be resolved in the `vulkan-context` class.

## Bootstrapping Vulkan

The final change we need to make is in our core `engine` code which creates our application. At the moment it only tries to create the OpenGL application like so:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<ast::Application> resolveApplication()
{
    static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "resolveApplication"};

    try
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "Creating OpenGL application ...");
        return std::make_unique<ast::OpenGLApplication>();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& error)
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "OpenGL application failed to initialize.", error);
    }

    throw std::runtime_error(logTag + " No applications can run in the current environment");
}
```

We will update this method to do the following:

- Check if Vulkan is available through our `ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable()` function.
- If Vulkan is available, attempt to create a new instance of an `ast::VulkanApplication` and return it.
- If an instance of the Vulkan application could not be created, fall back to the OpenGL application instead.

Add the following header includes to `engine.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "../application/vulkan/vulkan-application.hpp"
#include "../application/vulkan/vulkan-common.hpp"
```

Then update the `resolveApplication` function with the following:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<ast::Application> resolveApplication()
{
    static const std::string logTag{classLogTag + "resolveApplication"};

    if (ast::vulkan::isVulkanAvailable())
    {
        try
        {
            ast::log(logTag, "Creating Vulkan application ...");
            return std::make_unique<ast::VulkanApplication>();
        }
        catch (const std::exception& error)
        {
            ast::log(logTag, "Vulkan application failed to initialize.", error);
        }
    }

    try
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "Creating OpenGL application ...");
        return std::make_unique<ast::OpenGLApplication>();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& error)
    {
        ast::log(logTag, "OpenGL application failed to initialize.", error);
    }

    throw std::runtime_error(logTag + " No applications can run in the current environment");
}
```

Save and run the console project and as long as you are running on a Mac with Metal support you should see an empty black window appear but with the Vulkan console output indicating that it worked successfully.

> Note: In the screenshot below I'm directly running `./a-simple-triangle-console` via Terminal in the `out` folder to make it a bit easier to see the logging output from our application. When running through Visual Studio Code you will see the same thing except the logging statements would be displayed within the appropriate console output panel.

## Summary

Next up we'll setup the MacOS application to initialise Vulkan.
