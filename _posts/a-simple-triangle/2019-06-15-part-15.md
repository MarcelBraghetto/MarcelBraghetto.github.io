In this article we will take our basic Vulkan initialisation into the MacOS platform target. Most of the effort to do this is updating the Xcode project structure to include the correct libraries and files - most of the C++ is already done from the previous article.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Setup script

The MacOS platform target is very similar to our console app so we'll get a good amount of reuse from our setup scripts we wrote in the previous article.

Open up the `macos/setup.sh` script and add the following command directly beneath the existing `fetch_framework_sdl2_image` command:

```sh
fetch_third_party_lib_vulkan_macos
setup_vulkan_libs_macos
```

This will download the Vulkan SDK for MacOS if necessary and copy the Vulkan `dylib` files into the `Frameworks` folder if needed.

Run the setup script in Terminal in the `macos` folder and observe the dynamic library files have now been copied into the `Frameworks` folder:

```
: root
  + macos
    + Frameworks
      libMoltenVK.dylib
      libvulkan.1.dylib
```

We also need to create the same `vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json` structure within our `macos` folder exactly like for the console target - and you can commit it to version control too. Create the folders and JSON file like so:

```
: root
  + macos
    + vulkan
      + icd.d
        MoltenVK_icd.json
```

The content of the `MoltenVK_icd.json` file should be the same as for the console target:

```json
{
    "file_format_version" : "1.0.0",
    "ICD": {
        "library_path": "../../Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib",
        "api_version" : "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

We now need to update the `project.yml` file to stitch the libraries and resources into our Xcode project. Open the `macos/project.yml` file for editing.

**Vulkan SDK headers**

To include the Vulkan headers we will update the `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` section - observe the additional Vulkan include path:

```yml
HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS:
    - $(PROJECT_DIR)/../../third-party/SDL/include
    - $(PROJECT_DIR)/../../third-party/glm
    - $(PROJECT_DIR)/../../third-party/tiny-obj-loader
    - $(PROJECT_DIR)/../../third-party/SDL2_image
    - $(PROJECT_DIR)/../../third-party/vulkan-mac/macOS/include
```

**Link Vulkan dynamic library files**

Next we need to link the `dylib` files into our Xcode project - edit the `dependencies` section to look like this:

```yml
dependencies:
    - framework: Frameworks/SDL2.framework
    embed: true
    - framework: Frameworks/SDL2_image.framework
    embed: true
    - framework: Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib
    embed: true
    - framework: Frameworks/libvulkan.1.dylib
    embed: true
    - sdk: OpenGL.framework
```

Observe the addition of the two `dylib` files.

**MoltenVK ICD meta data**

We also need to include the `vulkan` folder as a resource asset so it gets bundled up and included in the application so it can find it at runtime and therefore bootstrap the MoltenVK ICD. Update the `sources` section to include the `vulkan` folder in the `resources` build phase:

```yml
sources:
    - Source
    - path: assets
        type: folder
        buildPhase: resources
    - path: vulkan
        type: folder
        buildPhase: resources
```

Save and close the `project.yml` file the run `setup.sh` again. Open the Xcode project and note the addition of the dynamic libraries and the `vulkan` resource folder.

Run the project from Xcode and Vulkan should boot up successfully:

## Summary

That was pretty easy huh? Next up we will tackle iOS.
