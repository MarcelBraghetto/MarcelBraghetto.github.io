In this part we will setup a Jenkins instance using Docker to run it, and connect it to Bitbucket so it can automatically start build pipelines.

## Installing Jenkins

Jenkins has a Docker image available from Docker Hub but we are going to actually make our own Docker image from it as we need to customise it a tiny bit.

The customisation is needed to allow Jenkins to actually start and stop Docker images itself during build pipelines - out of the box the default Jenkins Docker image doesn't seem to be able to do this. Thankfully it is quite trivial to apply this customisation.

## Jenkins Dockerfile

Create a new folder named `iac-jenkins` as a sibling to the `setup/iac-env` folder with a `Dockerfile` and `create-docker-image.sh` script in it, along with a `start-jenkins.sh` script we will use to start Jenkins:

```
.
├─+ example-project
├─+ setup
│   ├─+ iac-env
│   └─+ iac-jenkins
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       └── create-docker-image.sh
├── start-bitbucket.sh
└── start-jenkins.sh
```

Enter the following into `setup/iac-jenkins/Dockerfile`:

```docker
FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.2.35-alpine
LABEL description 'Infrastructure as Code - Jenkins (iac-env-jenkins).'
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache docker=18.09.8-r0
```

As you can see the Dockerfile is quite simple, all it does is use `jenkins/jenkins:2.2.35-alpine` as a base, then install `docker` into it. Installing Docker inside a Docker image might seem strange but later we will be running our build pipeline that needs to start and stop Docker containers from *within* the running Jenkins container. Adding `docker` into the Jenkins image allows it to do this.

Enter the following into `setup/iac-jenkins/create-docker-image.sh`, and apply executable permissions to it:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pushd $(cd $(dirname $0) && pwd)
    docker build -t iac-jenkins .
popd
```

This looks very similar to the script we wrote for the `iac-env` image - it will invoke Docker to build the image based on the `Dockerfile` and tag the result as `iac-jenkins`.

Run the script to build the image, then check to see what Docker images we now have:

```
$ setup/iac-jenkins/create-docker-image.sh

$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            SIZE
iac-jenkins                  latest              fe6d0797ca13        495MB
iac-env                      latest              1541cb836ece        714MB
atlassian/bitbucket-server   6.10                09c4f264b197        945MB
jenkins/jenkins              2.2.35-alpine       58047ae198b8        228MB
ubuntu                       bionic              c3c304cb4f22        64.2MB
```

Notice we have both `jenkins/jenkins:2.2.35-alpine` and `iac-jenkins:latest` images now which is cool!

Now enter the following into `start-jenkins.sh` and mark it as executable:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# After Jenkins has started it can be browsed at http://localhost:8080
# To access the Jenkins home folder you can mount the Docker volume
# assigned to Jenkins with the volume name: 'jenkins-data', typically
# found at: /var/lib/docker/volumes/jenkins-data on Linux. If you are
# running Docker on MacOS, the volumes are hidden inside a Docker VM.
#
# Jenkins will auto restart itself after a system shutdown/reboot unless
# it was manually stopped, so theoretically you should only need to ever
# start it once. If for some reason you do want to manually stop Jenkins,
# use the following command:
#
# docker stop jenkins
#
echo 'Starting Jenkins ...'
docker run \
    -d \
    --name jenkins \
    --network iac-env \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --publish 50000:50000 \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    iac-jenkins:latest
```

We are publishing ports `8080` and `50000` which are what Jenkins runs on and mapping its data volume to a Docker persistent volume named `jenkins-data`. We are also specifying the `--network iac-env` parameter like we did for our other Docker images. The following line might seem a bit mysterious:

```
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
```

This line maps the Docker application inside the Jenkins image to actually execute its Docker commands on through the Docker application on the *host* machine. We do this to avoid running Docker containers inside Docker containers.

## Start Jenkins

Run the `start-jenkins.sh` script to boot up Jenkins. You can reach it via `http://localhost:8080` - give it a minute to boot up though. Eventually you will be greeted by this screen:

<img src="/images/iac-env/jenkins-unlock.png" />

Now, I bet if you go and try to find `/var/jenkins_home` you'll discover it doesn't exist! The reason is that we are running Jenkins inside a Docker container, and we associated a Docker volume for Jenkins to use, which in fact is located at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/jenkins-data` on Linux, and is buried inside a Docker VM if you are running on MacOS.

To get the initial admin password you can run this:

```
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Basically we are just invoking a command on the running container that looks inside its own file system and prints the result.

Copy the output and paste it into the `Administrator password` field - also remember it for when Jenkins restarts when you will need to login again.

Select `Install suggested plugins` from the next screen as there are a few standard Jenkins plugins we will be using.

On the `Create first admin user` screen just select `Continue as admin`, then `Save and Finish`, `Start using Jenkins`. You are welcome to do more user configuration if you like but for the purpose of this experiment we'll keep things as simple as possible.

## Install multi branch plugin

Once Jenkins starts, we will install the `Bitbucket Branch Source` plugin - [https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.adoc](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.adoc) - which will let us integrate with our Git repositories and detect Git branches for our build pipelines.

Go to `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Plugins` -> `Available tab` -> Search for and select `Bitbucket Branch Source` then selected `Download now and install after restart`.

Once Jenkins has restarted, we will configure the plugin to be able to communicate with our Bitbucket server.

> Note: Sometimes you have to refresh your browser manually if Jenkins doesn't appear to have restarted itself.

Go to `Manage Jenkins` -> `Configure System` then scroll down to the `Bitbucket Endpoints` section. It should look like this:

<img src="/images/iac-env/jenkins-bitbucket-config1.png" />

- Delete the default `Bitbucket Cloud` configuration and add a `Bitbucket Server` configuration instead.
- Enter `Bitbucket` in the `Name` field.
- Enter `http://bitbucket:7990` in the `Server URL` field, which is where Jenkins can find Bitbucket - remember, Bitbucket is hosted on the host machine within the `iac-env` Docker network, so we need to use `http://bitbucket` to reach it.
- Enable the `Manage hooks` checkbox - for some reason the page scrolls when you select this, so scroll back to the `Bitbucket Server` section again.
- Set the `Webhook implementation to use` to `Plugin`.
- Select `Add` -> `Jenkins` next to the `Credentials` field - this is where we will add the details of the `jenkins` user we created in Bitbucket, allowing Jenkins to authenticate with Bitbucket.
- Fill in the details using the credentials of the `jenkins` user you created in Bitbucket, like the following:

<img src="/images/iac-env/jenkins-add-bitbucket-user.png" />

Save the credential, then your `Bitbucket Endpoints` section should look like the following:

<img src="/images/iac-env/jenkins-bitbucket-endpoints-complete.png" />

Select the `Save` button at the lower left to save your changes.

## Create the build pipeline job

We can now create a new Jenkins build pipeline job, associating it with our Git repository in Bitbucket. Once the job has been created it will *scan* Bitbucket for any Git branches in our repository and detect new branches and Git changes.

To create the Jenkins job, select the `New Item` menu option. Enter `iac-example-project` in the `Item Name` field and select `Multibranch Pipeline` as the type.

Enter the following details in the configuration form:

- Display Name: Infrastructure as Code - Example Project
- Description: Example project
- Branch Sources: Bitbucket
- Credentials: Jenkins Bitbucket User
- Owner: IC
- Repository name: example-project

This job will inherit the Jenkins Bitbucket configuration we setup earlier. We are setting the `Owner` to be `IC` which is the project key in Bitbucket that we created. If the connectivity is working correctly, the `Repository name` field will actually provide you with a drop down box of all the repositories available under the `IC` project ID, from which we select `example-project`. This means that the job will be associated to any changes coming from the `IC/example-project` configuration.

Leave everything else as default for now and select `Save`.

Immediately after saving the job, Jenkins will kick of a *scan* to find out what branches it should be aware of. The output will likely look similar to this:

```
Started
Starting branch indexing...
Connecting to http://bitbucket:7990 using jenkins/****** (Jenkins Bitbucket User)
Repository type: Git
Looking up IC/example-project for branches

Checking branch master from IC/example-project
      ‘Jenkinsfile’ not found
    Skipped

  1 branches were processed
Looking up IC/example-project for pull requests

  0 pull requests were processed
Finished branch indexing. Indexing took 0.98 sec
Finished: SUCCESS
```

Jenkins was able to scan our Bitbucket repository, finding a `master` branch. By default Jenkins will attempt to locate a special file named `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the repository which contains the instructions for what to do run in its build pipeline. Our repository doesn't yet have a `Jenkinsfile` so we get the `'Jenkinsfile' not found` output in the build console. We'll create a Jenkinsfile in the next article.

If you navigate back to the Jenkins home screen you will see a new build pipeline project like this:

<img src="/images/iac-env/jenkins-pipeline-1.png" />

## Onward!

Next up we will create our `Jenkinsfile` which will define how and what to build in our pipeline.
