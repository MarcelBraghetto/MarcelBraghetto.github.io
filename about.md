Hi there! My name is Marcel and this is my tiny corner of the Internet. There isn't much here at the moment, but I'm working on it!

I've been writing software since I got my Commodore 128 *many* years ago (yes the 128 had twice the amount of RAM as the Commodore 64) using the [PET BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC) programming language.

I caught the programming bug and have been coding in all kinds of languages and technologies ever since, both professionally and for personal enjoyment.

Over the last few years I've focussed mostly on native mobile app development which is my current profession, however I enjoy all forms of tech!

For years I've been meaning to get around to writing up the things I learn and discover to share with others but just never really got around to it :S

I finally got the motivation to spend some time writing some posts and hopefully I can continue to grow this collection over time.

If you'd like to say hi, feel free to visit me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marcel-braghetto/73/90b/133), and most of the posts here have corresponding example source code in my [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcelBraghetto) page.

Enough of my waffling... enjoy my blog!

Marcel.
